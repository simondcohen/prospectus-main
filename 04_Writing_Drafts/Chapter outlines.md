**1. Opening Anecdote / Historical Scene (1–1.5 paragraphs)**

- Begin with a specific event, press clipping, controversy, or even a striking quotation.

- Let this episode naturally introduce the chapter’s central tensions, stakes, or themes.

- *Tip*: Show rather than tell—let the example “unfold” into the broader questions.

**2. Research Questions & Chronological/Conceptual Justification (1 short paragraph)**

- Articulate the questions the chapter addresses, using the anecdote as a bridge.

- Explicitly connect the choice of year/period to these questions (“1863 matters because…”).

**3. Methodology, Sources, and Case Studies (1–2 paragraphs)**

- Outline the concrete materials you’ll use—be as specific as possible.

- Identify archives, printed sources, repertoires, legal cases, periodicals, etc.

- If helpful, divide into one paragraph for “how I’ll approach the material” and another for “what materials/case studies I’ll focus on.”

**4. Argument/Intervention & Broader Significance (1–2 paragraphs)**

- State what the chapter aims to show, how it moves the conversation forward, and why it matters for your dissertation’s overall architecture.

- You can combine argument and significance, or separate them, depending on how much you want to foreground each.
