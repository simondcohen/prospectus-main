Notes

**Notes on Excerpts from the *BULLETIN du Comité de la Langue, de l’Histoire et des Arts de la France*, Tome I (1852-1853)**

---

### 1 · pp 21-27 — Launching the *Recueil des poésies populaires*

- **Decree of 13 September 1852** fixes four repertory categories—religious/war songs, fête ballads, historical legends, satires—and assigns editorial power to the Comité.
- Early correspondence already sorts submissions into “insignificant” versus “usable,” foreshadowing a gate-keeping logic.
- Debate over opening with a *chanson de geste* volume versus shorter legends points to the high/low boundary work you track (romance ↔ chanson populaire).

### 2 · pp 48-51 — Draft “Classification System”

- Members consider renaming *chanson de geste* as “romance narrative,” signalling discomfort with heavy medievalist jargon yet seeking an epic framing.
- The layered commissions and sub-commissions reveal a bureaucracy almost as large as the corpus it hopes to catalogue—fodder for your property-valuation thread.

### 3 · pp 96-100 — “Oral / Written” Division

- Speakers wrestle with whether chapbook songs still count as *populaires*—a perfect illustration of your continuum argument and the era’s anxiety over print mediation.
- One member proposes school use as the ultimate authenticity test, tying song collection to imperial pedagogy.

### 4 · pp 180-183 — Medieval Categories Revisited

- A philologist maps current folk genres onto trouvère/troubadour taxonomies, pushing a millennium-long lineage that feeds your “same melody, different masks” motif.

### 5 · pp 280-281 — Official Instructions (Philology Section)

- Circulars demand “exact transcripts” and forbid modernised spelling, yet simultaneously ask for neat translations—exposing the project’s twin (and conflicting) goals of purity and legibility.

### 6 · pp 346-349 — Musical Dimension of Popular Poetry

- Minutes note that Conservatoire figures Edmond Elwart and Beauchet volunteer as musical arrangers, confirming that melodies, not just words, were in scope.
- This is prime material for your machine/body dialectic: once melodies enter print they become portable capital.

### 7 · pp 421-423 — Popular-Poetry Outreach Proposal

- A plan surfaces to publish cheap broadsides and send them to mayors for local fêtes—imperial soft power in action.
- Provincial-dialect pieces are framed as tools to “reconcile local pride with national feeling,” echoing Louis-Napoléon’s hybrid-sovereignty rhetoric.

### 8 · pp 435-437 — Selection-Criteria Refinement

- Referees debate whether satirical or risqué verses may enter the *Recueil*; moral sanitising wins the day, bolstering your “curate and cleanse” argument.
- A medal for “best contributors” is floated, subtly monetising cultural capital.

### 9 · pp 582-583 — Progress Report (late 1853)

- Tallies show hundreds of pieces received but only a fraction vetted—evidence of bureaucratic overload and the limits of central control.
- Thanks offered to regional clergy hint that Church networks became de-facto fieldworkers—another sovereignty layer to unpack.

### Cross-cutting take-aways

- **Imperial legitimacy via antiquity-plus-people.** The decree’s epic categories and medieval framing stage the Second Empire as guardian of an unbroken folk lineage.
- **From collecting to curating.** Repeated boundary-drawing (genre, morality, oral vs print) shows the Comité inventing an “official” folk memory rather than merely rescuing one.
- **Music as technology and commodity.** Demands for notation, offers from Conservatoire experts, and talk of medals reveal how melodies were folded into circuits of prestige and exchange.
- **Pedagogical reach.** Outreach schemes aimed squarely at schools and civic fêtes confirm that the *Recueil* was conceived as cultural infrastructure, not a dusty archive.
