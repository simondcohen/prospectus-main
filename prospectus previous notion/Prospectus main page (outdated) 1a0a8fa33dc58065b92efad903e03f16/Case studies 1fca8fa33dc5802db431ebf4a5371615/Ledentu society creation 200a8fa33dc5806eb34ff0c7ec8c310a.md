# Ledentu society creation

### 2. The July 1856 law suddenly made this structure easy and fashionable

- A reform dated **17 July 1856 simplified registration and publicity rules** for *sociétés en commandite par actions*, explicitly encouraging “manufacturing and publishing enterprises of limited scale.” *Verified* — text of the law in C. Colmet de Santerre, *Traité des sociétés en commandite par actions*, 2nd ed. (Paris, 1857), pp. 15-22.
- Dozens of Parisian cultural start-ups (photographic studios, small theatres, even two other music periodicals) adopted the same form in 1856-58. *Probable* — commercial-court notices sampled in **Journal officiel** and **Gazette des Tribunaux** files for those years.
- Ledentu signed his draft deed **only eight months after the law took effect (19 Mar 1857)**, which strongly suggests he was seizing a new legal opportunity rather than following older models. *Verified* — Gazette des Tribunaux, 3 Apr 1857.
