# Bordeaux incident

Potential sources (need to verify)

- **Grand-Théâtre staffing and finances (1861-63).** Press notes show Biche-Latour hiring Paris singers (Mme Gasc, Dufresne, Bataille) and staging *La Dame blanche* and *Guillaume Tell*; they praise his “capacité incontestable” yet hint at budget strain —signs that an extra revenue-stream such as a café-concert made sense.

- **The Alcazar’s position.** The café-concert across the Garonne was inaugurated **30 May 1861** and quickly became Bordeaux’s premier popular venue. Martial Léglise (nicknamed **“Bazas”**) is listed as its first director. The hall drew crowds away from the costly lyric stage—a dynamic noted by prefects nationwide after the 1864 deregulation.
- **Prefectural correspondence (Dec 1862 – Mar 1863).** Although not digitised, the folder **167 T 14, Correspondance 1863** (Archives Départementales de la Gironde) reportedly contains:
    - Biche-Latour’s request for an *annexe-café-concert* licence attached to the theatre foyer;
    - Léglise’s counter-petition stressing “concurrence déloyale” and potential moral disorder;
    - the prefect’s refusal, invoking the existing privilege (monopoly) of the Alcazar’s licence and the city subsidy voted for grand opera.
    
    Abbate’s article quotes these points almost verbatim, but the originals would allow full confirmation.

### How solid is the story?

*No contrary evidence surfaced in digitised newspapers, municipal minutes or trade almanacs of 1862-63.*  All threads point the same way: the application existed, Léglise opposed it, and the prefect blocked it.

Because we have not yet inspected 167 T 14 ourselves, the overall rating remains **Probable but well-sourced**.  A quick visit (or a reproduction order) to the Archives de la Gironde would lift it to **Verified**.

### If you need to dig deeper

1. **Consult 167 T 14 in person** (Archives Dépt. Gironde, Bordeaux; series T = Spectacles).
2. **Search the *Sémaphore de Bordeaux* or *La Gironde* (early 1863 issues)** for public notices of licence applications or prefectural decrees.
3. **Check municipal-council minutes** (Archives municipales de Bordeaux, series R) around February 1863—the city often debated theatre privileges there.
4. For Léglise’s side, the privately printed leaflet *L’Alcazar contre le Grand-Théâtre* (advertised in *La Gironde* 5 May 1863) may survive in the BnF’s *Département des arts du spectacle*.
