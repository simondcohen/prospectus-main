## Introduction & Rationale

This dissertation argues that the Second French Empire (1852–70) did not merely host a fashion for *chanson populaire*; it **manufactured “the popular” as a dominant aesthetic regime** through the intertwined infrastructures of law, print capitalism, and mechanical mediation. Tracking four flashpoints—1852–53 canon‑making, 1858 print speculation, 1867 colonial relief spectacles, and the 1870–71 political fracture—I show how popular song moved from state‑sponsored folklore to imperial commodity to contested revolutionary weapon.

**Threads that bind the chapters**

1. **Infrastructure over oeuvre.** Instead of a single repertoire, each chapter maps how legal decrees, catalogues, charity bills, and press satire conditioned what *could* be heard as popular.
2. **Mechanics of circulation.** From lithographic songbooks to barrel organs and café‑concert programmes, mechanical reproduction underwrote both commercial expansion and the loosening of authorship.
3. **Politics of legitimacy.** Popular song served successive regimes—Bonapartist plebiscite, colonial philanthropy, republican barricades—until the Commune shattered any pretense of consensual “people’s music.”

**Contribution**  The study reframes French musical modernity by showing that debates over “absolute” versus “popular” music were already structured by print‑capital logics and colonial extractions in the 1850s–60s. It links musicological analysis to media history and imperial studies, offering a new template for reading sound as political economy.

# Chapter 1 – 1852–53: Canonising the *Chanson Populaire*

**Core question**

How did the intersecting projects of state‑sponsored collection (Fortoul’s *Recueil*), commercial anthologies (Wekerlin’s *Échos du temps passé*; Garnier Frères’ *Chansons populaires* series), and feuilleton nostalgia collectively recast the *chanson populaire* as a politically useful emblem of "the people" in the opening years of the Second Empire?

**Key themes**

- Nostalgic republican memory vs. Bonapartist populism: the song as symbolic terrain.
- Print‑culture synergies: cheap illustrated songbooks, salon arrangements, and mass stereotyping.
- Authority & authenticity: folklorists’ fieldwork pitched against publisher‑driven curation.

**Primary materials**

- Fortoul enquête archives; Ampère’s 1853 *Instructions*.
- Wekerlin, *Échos du temps passé* (1st ed. 1850; rev. 1853).
- *Chansons populaires françaises* (Garnier Frères, 1852–53) with illustrations by Gustave Doré.
- Reception in *Le Ménestrel*, *Revue des Deux Mondes*, and *Le Charivari*.

**Analytic focus**

- Comparative paratexts (prefaces, typography, iconography) to trace shifting meanings of “popular”.
- Musical remediation: modal ‘folk’ tunes harmonised for bourgeois parlour consumption.
- Overlap mapping: shared melodies across state, commercial, and salon collections to expose intertwined repertorial economies.

# Chapter 2 – 1858: Print Capital & the Romance Economy

**Core question**

What can Alfred Ikelmer’s flamboyant catalogues and the ensuing lawsuits reveal about the commodification of “popular” song in the Second‑Empire print marketplace?

**Key themes**

- Music as virtual capital: trademarks, *concurrence déloyale*, and the thin line between piracy and promotion.
- Marketing the popular: national‑song anthologies, inflated circulation figures, pseudonymous composers.
- Collapse of speculative ventures: Ikelmer’s bankruptcy as a case study in musical finance.

**Primary materials**

- Ikelmer firm catalogue (1858–59); Giacomelli’s critiques in *La Presse théâtrale et musicale*.
- Court judgment *Commerson v. Ikelmer* (Tribunal de commerce, Apr 1857).
- Bankruptcy inventories (1860).

**Analytic focus**

- Discursive construction of value: how catalogue hyperbole links to broader notions of popularity.
- Repertoire circulation: arrangements of *Partant pour la Syrie*, *God Save the Queen*, and Strauss’s *Les 500 diables* quadrille.

# Chapter 3 – 1867: Charity Balls, Mechanical Music & Imperial Relief

**Core question**

How did the 1867 Algerian earthquake‑relief cycle harness mechanical mediation to turn “popular” tunes into philanthropic currency and expose imperial tensions around musical property?

**Key themes**

- Charity balls as miniature exposition showcases.
- Mechanical sound and loosened authorship (brass bands, barrel organs, minstrelsy).
- Property, philanthropy, and colonial governance.

**Primary materials**

- Borghèse benefit press notices & programme (11 Jan 1867).
- “La Famille” mutual‑aid ball notice (6 Feb 1867).
- Garrison artillery vaudeville playbill (1 Feb 1867).
- Flavacourt column on cafés‑chantants & droits d’auteur (9 Jun 1867).
- San Fernando hurricane concert poster (2 Dec 1867?).
- Maxime Du Camp, “La Mendicité” (1869).

**Analytic focus**

- Repertoire overlaps (*Partant pour la Syrie*, *God Save the Queen*) across metropolitan and colonial sites.
- Pricing/scheduling as indicators of charity‑commerce hybridity.
- Discursive links between mechanical music, philanthropy, and legal control of the poor.

# Chapter 4 – 1870–71: Satire, War & the Fracture of “Popular” Song

**Core question**

How did the Franco‑Prussian War and Paris Commune break apart the Second‑Empire consensus around “popular” song, turning shared anthems into contested political weapons?

**Key themes**

- Anthem politics: reinstatement of *La Marseillaise* and eclipse of *Partant pour la Syrie*.
- Satire and parody in plebiscite culture and wartime press.
- Revolutionary remediation: Commune barricade songs and elite concert series.

**Primary materials**

- *Le Gaulois* satire (Jan 1869).
- *L’Aube* commentary (2 Oct 1869).
- “Chants patriotiques” advert (*Le Ménestrel*, 31 Jul 1870).
- “Chant du Plébiscite” (*Le Charivari*, 25 May 1870).
- Street‑song “La Canaille” (1865; Bouvier/Darcier).
- Delphine Mordey, “Moments musicaux” (2010) – Commune concert documentation.

**Analytic focus**

- From bundled patriotism to fractured soundscape: tracking the fall of *Partant* and ascendancy of *Marseillaise*.
- Parody as political critique in plebiscite and wartime press.
- Interplay of street, café‑concert, and elite repertoires within revolutionary Paris.

# Version 2 05/13/25

## Introduction & Rationale

This dissertation reassesses musical life under the Second French Empire (1852 – 70) by asking how state bureaux, commercial print networks, and emerging mechanical media **re‑defined the category of “popular” song**. Rather than treating *chanson populaire* as a spontaneous folk residue, I show that various institutions—imperial ministries, music‑printing firms, colonial theatres—actively **consolidated** and circulated the term through specific legal and material practices. Four conjunctures structure the inquiry: the 1852–53 state folklorist drive; the 1858 speculative boom in cheap songbooks; the 1867 charity‑ball cycle in colonial Algiers; and the wartime and revolutionary crises of 1870–71. Each episode illuminates a different mechanism by which songs moved from regional folklore to national commodity to politicised symbol.

### Orienting concepts

1. **Infrastructure before repertoire.** Following media historians such as Lisa Gitelman, I treat catalogues, lithographic presses, benefit playbills, and barrel‑organ cylinders as *scripts*: protocols that shape how music can be stored, copied, and heard.
2. **Material hegemony.** Adapting Chandra Mukerji’s work on state engineering, I read these scripts as part of the Empire’s soft infrastructure—networks that underwrote political authority by organising sonic experience.
3. **Empty signifier “populaire.”** Ernesto Laclau’s theory of populism describes how disparate demands cohere around a floating signifier; here *populaire* (and emblem tunes such as *Partant pour la Syrie* or *La Marseillaise*) gathers heterogenous publics until wartime defeat fractures that chain of equivalence.
4. **Distribution of the sensible.** Jacques Rancière’s notion that aesthetics partitions what can be perceived guides my attention to who gains or loses the right to sound French across these flashpoints.

### Contribution

By embedding music in imperial media and legal networks, the study reframes mid‑nineteenth‑century French modernity: debates over “art” versus “popular” music were already conditioned by print capitalism, colonial extraction, and shifting political legitimacy. The epilogue gestures toward 1870s republican reforms, showing that the infrastructures persisted even as their ideological valence changed.

# Chapter 1 – 1852–53: State Folklore & Commercial Anthologies

**Core question**

How did the Ministry of Public Instruction’s folk‑song enquête and nearly simultaneous commercial anthologies (Wekerlin, Garnier Frères) jointly transform regional song into a usable symbol of “the people” at the dawn of the Empire?

**Key themes**

- Republican nostalgia versus Bonapartist populism.
- Print synergies: illustrated cheap editions, salon arrangements, and mass stereotyping.
- Authenticity debates between field collectors and publishers.

**Primary materials**

- Fortoul circulars; Ampère’s *Instructions* (1853).
- Wekerlin, *Échos du temps passé* (1850/53).
- Garnier’s *Chansons populaires françaises* (1852–53) with Doré illustrations.
- Press reception in *Le Ménestrel*, *Revue des Deux Mondes*, *Le Charivari*.

**Analytic focus**

- Paratexts (prefaces, typography, iconography) that recast provincial airs for urban readers.
- Harmonisation practices that translate modal tunes into salon idioms.
- Melody overlap across state, commercial, and domestic spheres.

# Chapter 2 – 1858: Speculation, Piracy & the Romance Economy

**Core question**

What does Alfred Ikelmer’s high‑volume catalogue—and the ensuing piracy suit—reveal about the financialisation of “popular” song within the Second‑Empire print marketplace?

**Key themes**

- Music as notional capital: trademarks and *concurrence déloyale*.
- Marketing nationalism: inflated circulation figures, pseudonymous “folk” composers.
- Bankruptcy and legal remedy as mirrors of speculative excess.

**Primary materials**

- Ikelmer catalogue (1858–59); Giacomelli columns in *La Presse théâtrale et musicale*.
- *Commerson v. Ikelmer* judgment (Tribunal de commerce, Apr 1857).
- Bankruptcy inventories (1860).

**Analytic focus**

- Catalogue hyperbole as discourse of value.
- Circulation of emblem tunes (*Partant*, *God Save the Queen*, Strauss quadrilles) through derivative arrangements.

# Chapter 3 – 1867: Charity, Mechanical Media & Colonial Relief

**Core question**

How did earthquake‑relief entertainments in Algiers mobilise mechanically reproducible tunes as philanthropic currency while exposing colonial tensions in musical property rights?

**Key themes**

- Benefit evenings as miniature exposition showcases.
- Mechanical sound and loosened authorship (brass bands, barrel organs, minstrelsy).
- Philanthropy, property, and governance in the imperial periphery.

**Primary materials**

- Borghèse benefit notices & programme (11 Jan 1867).
- “La Famille” mutual‑aid ball notice (6 Feb 1867).

**Analytic focus**

- Overlapping repertories (*Partant*, *God Save the Queen*) across metropole and colony.
- Ticket pricing and scheduling as indicators of charity‑commerce hybridity.
- Discourse linking mechanical music, philanthropy, and social control.

# Chapter 4 – 1870–71: War, Revolution & the Unravelling of “Popular” Song

**Core question**

How did the Franco‑Prussian War and Paris Commune destabilise the Empire’s auditory consensus, turning previously shared tunes into competing political symbols while leaving the underlying commercial networks intact?

**Key themes**

- Anthem politics: reinstatement of *La Marseillaise*, eclipse and parody of *Partant*.
- Satire in plebiscite culture and wartime press.
- Revolutionary remediation: Commune barricade songs (*La Canaille*) and elite concert series.

**Primary materials**

- *Le Gaulois* satire (Jan 1869).
- *L’Aube* commentary (2 Oct 1869).
- “Chants patriotiques” advert (*Le Ménestrel*, 31 Jul 1870).

- Street‑song *La Canaille* (Bouvier/Darcier, 1865).
- Delphine Mordey, “Moments musicaux” (2010) – Commune concert data.

**Analytic focus**

- Collapse of the imperial anthem bundle; emergence of rival sonic publics.
- Parody as critique in plebiscite and wartime journalism.
- Persistence of café‑concert infrastructure into the early Third Republic, indicating re‑articulation rather than disappearance.

# Version 3 05/18

# Prospectus Revision Outline – Working Draft (May 18, 2025)

**Provisional Title:** *Forming the Popular: Representation and Reproduction in Second‑Empire France*

---

## 1 Introduction & Rationale

The French Second Empire (1852–70) witnessed an unprecedented saturation of everyday life with what contemporaries called *musique populaire*. Far from denoting a marginal, low‑status repertoire, the adjective *populaire* named a restless cultural logic that moved fluidly between state propaganda, speculative print capitalism, and colonial humanitarian display. This dissertation argues that, during these two decades, popular music was not the “third term” beneath art and folk but the primary lens through which French society negotiated legitimacy, labor, and affect. By following four conjunctures—1853, 1858, 1867, and 1870‑71—I show how songs, print, and performance forged an aesthetic of fungibility whose tensions illuminate both the empire’s self‑fashioning and the period’s broader political economy. In doing so, the study challenges teleological narratives that privilege the consolidation of autonomous “art music,” instead revealing a landscape in which the *popular* structured value across elite and vernacular spheres.

## 2 Conceptual & Theoretical Framework

- **Articulation & Mediation.** Drawing on Laclau & Mouffe’s theory of hegemony and Adorno’s concept of mediation, I treat the *popular* as an articulatory practice that sutures heterogeneous musical elements into a provisional social consensus.
- **Musical Logic of the Popular.** Instead of locating popularity in genre or style, I identify recurrent formal operations—modularity, citation, instant recognizability—that allow music to circulate as both affective charge and exchangeable commodity.
- **Beyond the Work.** Engaging Tomlinson, Denning, and Ochoa, I displace the autonomous‑work paradigm by foregrounding “song formations,” print technologies, and performance ecologies.

## 3 Historiographical Context

- **French Folk vs. Commercial Popular.** Revisits Gelbart, Scott, and Leterrier to show how binary schemata occlude the centrality of *musique populaire*.
- **Second Empire Spectacle.** Builds on literature from Da Costa Meyer to Benjamin to map the “panoramic” aesthetic of the 1850s‑60s.
- **Musicological Gaps.** Addresses critical omissions noted by Fulcher, Blaszkiewicz, Sabbatini, and Ellis—especially analytic tools for ephemeral, modular song.

## 4 Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1 — 1853: Songs for a New Empire

State‑sponsored folklorism (Fortoul project) meets commercial romance (*Partant pour la Syrie*). Shows how “folk” and “urban” popular were co‑constitutive.

### Chapter 2 — 1858: Speculation, Piracy & the Romance Economy

Banking scandals and music piracy around publisher Ikelmer illustrate music’s entanglement with financialized property regimes.

[New] Chapter 3: 1863: labor, cafe-concert, street music

### Chapter 3 — 1867: Charity, Colonialism & Affective Circuits

Benefit concerts in Algiers and the Caribbean reveal how popular songs mobilized humanitarian sentiment within imperial networks.

### Chapter 4 — 1870‑71: War, Revolution & the Unraveling of the Popular (working)

Considers the Commune and wartime crises to argue that the same musical logic facilitated both cohesion and rupture.

## 5 Methodology & Sources

- **Print Capital.** Sheet‑music catalogues, price lists, legal dossiers.
- **Periodical Press.** *Le Ménestrel*, *La Presse Théâtrale et Musicale*, colonial newspapers.
- **Archival Audio/Images.** Lithographs, playbills, surviving orchestrations.
- **Digital Humanities.** Database of song reuse across collections; GIS mapping of performance venues.

## 6 Contribution & Significance

- Reframes popular music as a dominant nineteenth‑century aesthetic in France.
- Offers a model for analyzing modular, citation‑based repertoires.
- Illuminates the cultural mechanics of the Bonapartist imperial project.

## 7 Immediate Next Steps

1. Expand the theoretical chapter to flesh out mediation/articulation stakes.
2. Consolidate literature review, pruning redundant summaries.
3. Gather additional primary sources for Chapter 4 (Commune broadsides, soldiers’ chansons).
4. Standardize citation style (Chicago notes‑bibliography).
5. Draft 1–2 polished sample sections for committee feedback.
