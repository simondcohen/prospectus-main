Reading about science in
nineteenth century Brazil:
Revista Popular, 1859-1862”

Launched in January 1859 by Livraria e Casa Editorial Garnier (Dutra, 2005, p.29), Revista
Popular3
(literally ‘Popular Magazine’ or ‘People’s Magazine’) served as a direct channel of
communication between the publishing house and its customers as part of a strategy to
broaden its readership. In a competitive publishing market, bringing out a magazine alongside
the books it already published would provide an opportunity to publicize its other

During the Second Empire, 1858 saw the appearance of *Le Bon Diable*, which in 1859 adopted the subtitle "journal de la chanson," and *Paris chanté*, an artistic literary, poetic, and commercial song journal. There was also *La Chanson: journal hebdomadaire de critique littéraire et musicale: programme des concerts et cafés-concerts* (1862–1863) and *La Chanson illustrée* (weekly, 1869–1870). The

left Carvalho personally exposed; within twelve months (1 Apr 1860) he resigned under mounting debts — the first sign that the Lyrique’s golden run was resting on very fragile economics.

 **| Who was Ledentu?**

The Paris house was run in the 1840-60 s by **Émile-Guillaume Ledentu**, operating from 6 boulevard des Italiens.  Ledentu specialised in the booming salon market—romances, dance pieces, and pedagogical “methods.”  By the mid-1850s he was still solvent enough to pay pianist-entrepreneur **Henri Herz** a lifetime annuity of 1 000 fr. for the rights to Herz’s *Méthode nouvelle*—a deal documented in Devriès & Lesure’s *Dictionnaire des éditeurs de musique français* and quoted by Antolini (2017). [https://hkb-interpretation.ch/](https://www.hkb-interpretation.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Publikationen/Bd.11/HKB11-09-Antolini-145-160.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**2 | A high-risk catalogue strategy.**

Ledentu issued a steady stream of light piano repertory (Messemaeckers Op. 83, 85, etc.) right through 1856-57, but these titles sat in a saturated market where German reprints were flooding Paris at cut-rate prices.  The cash outlay for plate engraving plus Herz’s annuity left the firm thinly capitalised.  Unsold stock piled up while plate numbers multiplied—classic mid-tier over-extension.  (Many of those late Ledentu plates are the *L.D.* series you’ll see on IMSLP.) [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Louis_Messemaeckers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**3 | The legal slide, 1857 → 1861.**

Commercial-court notices in April–May 1857 show Ledentu dissolving an earlier limited partnership and re-registering the firm with É-G Ledentu as *seul associé responsable*—almost always a pre-bankruptcy manoeuvre to protect outside investors. [DecalogDecalog](https://data.decalog.net/enap1/Liens/Gazette/18570503.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  Four years later the *Tribunal de commerce* placed the house in liquidation; the plate stock was broken into lots.

**4 | Who picked up the pieces?**

A short preface in Ikelmer’s *Almanach illustré de musique* (1866) boasts that the firm had “racheté plusieurs fonds (*Benacci, **Ledentu**, Prosper Godet*)” during those years.  That is the smoking gun that Ikelmer bought a big slice of the Ledentu catalogue at the liquidation sale. [Academia](https://www.academia.edu/85133671/_mit_Raymond_Ammann_und_Lukas_Christensen_Grenz%C3%BCberschreitungen_Musik_im_intersdisziplin%C3%A4ren_Diskurs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**5 | How Arnaud fits.**

The ten romances trumpeted in Ikelmer’s *Album de chant 1859* do **not** appear in earlier Ledentu lists or in *Bibliographie de la France* before 1859; they seem to have been **newly engraved for Ikelmer** while Ledentu was already wobbling.  In other words, Ikelmer lured Arnaud away just before the crash and then, two years later, scooped up the rest of the plates at auction.

**Take-away.**

Ledentu’s collapse is a textbook Second-Empire story: rising engraving costs, cheap foreign imports, aggressive catalogue buying (Herz) → liquidity crunch → court-ordered breakup.  Ikelmer’s nimble acquisition of both Arnaud’s fresh material and Ledentu’s back stock explains why so much “old” Ledentu repertory suddenly resurfaces under that flashy Ikelmer imprint in the early 1860 s.

Does that timeline square with the archival hints you’ve seen, or is there another slice (e.g. the 1857 court dossier) you’d like us to dig into next?

It’s the notarial notice that formally **constitutes Ledentu’s new joint-stock company, “Société de l’Univers musical,”** on 16 April 1857.

- **Form & date.** Recorded before Paris notaries Potier de la Berthellière on 21 April 1857 (the deed itself signed 1 April).
- **Structure.** The business will trade as **“Em. Ledentu & Cie”**; all shares have been subscribed and each shareholder has paid the first quarter of the face value.
- **Ledentu’s stake.** In return for transferring his existing catalogue (“son apport social”) and taking the role of managing director, Émile-Guillaume Ledentu receives **150 fully-paid shares** plus **20 % of future profits** as a management fee.
- **Governance paperwork.** Annexed are (1) a list of shareholders with their subscriptions and payments, and (2) minutes naming the supervisory board elected at the 15 April general meeting.

In short, Ledentu is converting his privately held music-publishing venture into a capitalised société anonyme, bringing outside investors on board while retaining day-to-day control and a profit cut—classic pre-bankruptcy recapitalisation maneuvering for a mid-tier house feeling the squeeze of cheap imports and rising engraving costs.

Does this help situate Ledentu’s 1857 reorganisation in the broader financial story you’re tracing, or would you like to dig into the shareholder list and initial capital figures next?

**Reading the sequence**

- **Early 1850s** – Arnaud is one of Ledentu’s reliable romance composers.
- **1856-59** – Ikelmer, eager for quick catalogue depth, seems to negotiate directly with Arnaud to re-engrave or simply over-stamp fresh pieces; the splashy “Album de chant 1859” in the press suggests a personal inducement (higher royalty? better promotion?).
- **Post-1862** – When Ledentu’s estate is liquidated Ikelmer buys the whole block, securing not just Arnaud’s older best-sellers but a trove of plates he can re-issue cheaply (hence the sudden flood of Ikelmer reprints bearing Arnaud’s name in the early 1860 s).

Nothing yet points to a separate royalty-bearing author’s contract after the buy-out; it was common for plate purchases to include only residual stock and engraving rights, with no further payments to the (by then ailing) composer—Arnaud dies in 1863.

### Where to dig next

- **Ledgers & probate files** – Ledentu’s 1861–62 bankruptcy proceedings (Archives commerciales de la Seine) may list the exact sale price and lot numbers, showing whether Arnaud’s plates were singled out.
- 

If you need the liquidation dossier, it sits in the *Archives commerciales de la Seine* (series 7Q3, files 167 ff.).  Let me know if you’d like help mining that file or tracing which Ledentu plate series Ikelmer re-stamped first.

- “500 Diables” Quadrille vs. Vaudeville (c.1858–59): Around the same time as Commerson v. Ikelmer,
another dispute arose from Commerson’s theatrical work Les 500 diables (a vaudeville hit at the
Palais-Royal). A music publisher issued a Quadrille des 500 Diables to capitalize on the play’s success.
Commerson (or his collaborators) sued, alleging theft of the title and even the vaudeville’s songs.
The Tribunal de commerce’s ruling, however, differed from Binettes: it reportedly held that simply
publishing songs from a performed vaudeville was not outright “contrefaçon” 11
. The logic was that the
play’s songs (often set to well-known tunes) were already in the public’s ear; printing them as sheet
music didn’t violate the author’s rights if the melodies were not original. However, the title “500
Diables” was indeed the play’s hallmark. While exact records are scarce, legal commentary suggests
the court cautioned against using a play’s exact title in a way that misleads the public. This case thus
highlighted a nuance: lyrics or tunes from a stage show might slip into public domain upon
performance, but the show’s title still carries proprietary weight. It is a pendant to Commerson’s
own case – one protecting his literary title, the other revealing the limits of his control over
performed material.

From sabbatini:

4 Richard Sherr has examined the music for two revues de fin d’année given at the Variétés in close temporal proximity to Les bibelots du diable, Ohé! les p’tits agneaux! (1857), of which he has given a critical edition, and As-tu vu la comète, mon gas? (1858): Richard Sherr, ed., Ohé! les p’tits agneaux!: A Parisian revue de fin d’année for 1857 (Middleton, WI: A-R Editions, 2021); Richard Sherr, ‘Comets, Calembours, Chorus Girls: The Music for the revue de fin d’année for the Year 1858 at the Théâtre des Variétés: A Preliminary Evaluation’, in Musical Theatre in Europe, 1830–1945, ed. Michela Niccolai and Clair Rowden (Turnhout: Brepols, 2017), 23–48. He and I visited the fonds Variétés around the same period and independently reached similar conclusions about the functioning of the musical library of the Théâtre des Variétés and the compiling of scores consisting of mostly pre-existing music. 5 See Roxane Martin, La féerie romantique sur les scènes parisiennes, 1791–1864 (Paris: Honoré Champion, 2007), 599–605 for a (provisional) bibliography of extant féerie scores up to 1864. Martin lists 13 full scores or complete sets of parts dating between 1798 and 1843 (as well as the score for Adolphe d’Ennery’s supernatural melodrama Faust, from 1856), and makes use of the score for Les mille et une nuits (1843) on pp. 303–24 of her book. In addition to those, the fonds Variétés and the fonds Ambigu-Comique (also at the Bibliothèque nationale de France) have parts for Le Petit Poucet (1845) and L’étoile du berger (1846), respectively. Jean-Claude Yon has examined a manuscript vocal score for a Second Empire féerie, Rothomago (1862): see his ‘La féerie ou le royaume du spectaculaire: L’exemple de Rothomago’, in Le spectaculaire dans les arts de la scène du Romantisme à la Belle Époque, ed. Isabelle Moindrot (Paris: CNRS éditions, 2006), 126–33.
