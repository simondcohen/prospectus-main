During the Second Empire, 1858 saw the appearance of *Le Bon Diable*, which in 1859 adopted the subtitle "journal de la chanson," and *Paris chanté*, an artistic literary, poetic, and commercial song journal. There was also *La Chanson: journal hebdomadaire de critique littéraire et musicale: programme des concerts et cafés-concerts* (1862–1863) and *La Chanson illustrée* (weekly, 1869–1870). The

The parallel between newspaper and song is very clearly established by Alfred Assolant in his *Chronique de Cadet Borniche*, which began at the end of 1863: after lamenting the emptiness of certain song shows, the narrator, who advocates for the existence of "good taste popular scenes," asserts: "If drama or opera is a book, then the little comedy or the song would be a newspaper article" (January 4, 1864).

- **(V)** *Paris crossover.* By 1862 Offenbach’s *Bouffes-Parisiens* cherry-picked comic talent from cafés-concerts, while stars such as Thérésa moved the other way, turning the Eldorado into a fashionable stop for operetta composers scouting new material. (Delvau, *Histoire anecdodique*, 1862.)
- **(V)** *Provincial turf wars.* In **Bordeaux (1862-63)** the Grand-Théâtre’s manager Biche-Latour tried to open a café-concert annex; the rival Alcazar’s director Martial Léglise lobbied the prefect to block it – an early sign that light entertainment was eroding the subsidised operatic monopoly. *Source:* M. Everist, “Unintended Consequences,” *Cambridge Opera Journal* 22/3 (2010), citing Arch. Dépt Gironde 167 T 14
- **(V)** *Marseille & Rouen (1860-63).* Opera impresario Olivier Halanzier fought similar battles, seeking municipal exclusivity against encroaching cafés-concerts. *Source:* same article, Arch. Mun. Marseille 77 R 37

## 5 Questions worth pursuing next

1. **Wage scales below the star level.** Police licence renewals (AN F^21 1330-1345) include itemised budgets that should corroborate the anecdotal 3–5 fr cachets.
2. **SACEM licence registers (1858-65).** Annual lump-sum agreements will quantify each hall’s music budget and show how enforcement worked outside Paris.
3. **Artist mobility maps.** Tracking names across the *Almanach des spectacles* (1862-63) and provincial playbills could visualise the café-concert network in real time.

- **(P)** *Towards a welfare net.* The hardships above fed directly into the founding (Feb 1865) of the **Union des artistes lyriques des cafés-concerts**, the first mutual-aid society for this milieu. The preparatory petitions begin in 1863 (Series AJ^13, Archives nationales).

### 1 Who actually *made* a complainte?

- **Text & sheets:** drafted (often anonymously) by hack writers, set in type by specialised presses, then stamped by the *Commission d’examen des livres du colportage*. A finished broadside cost c. 10 centimes and could be printed by the thousand. Darriulat notes, for example, the 1864 *Grande complainte de Jacques Latour* sold at that price Darriulat - 2021 - Chan….
- **Melody:** almost always a recycled hit (“Air : Fualdès”, “Air : Malbrough”), so no notation had to be printed.

**See the Commission d’examen des livres du colportage, etc (discusssed in the criminelles article—important lead)**

- See also: J.F. "Maxou" Heintzen, “La complainte criminelle,” in *Criminocorpus* (2011), which discusses how the *colportage* stamp specifically restricted the market for printed street songs.
