# Chapter 1 — 1853: Songs for a New Empire

This chapter examines *chanson populaire* in the year 1853 to understand what this musical category meant during the first full year of Napoleon III's new French Empire. My inquiry centers on how the Ministry of Public Instruction's folk-song *enquête* and simultaneous commercial anthologies jointly transformed regional song into a usable symbol of "the people" at the dawn of the Second Empire. While traditional musicological frameworks have separated folkloric *chanson populaire* (indigenous folk songs) from the commercial *romance* (associated with amateur salon culture), I argue that these categories were not opposed but part of a shared logic of popular culture during this pivotal period.

The folkloric understanding of *chanson populaire* gained its first significant momentum in France with the collection project initiated by Hippolyte Fortoul in 1852. On November 15, Fortoul, the Minister of Public Instruction, announced his proposal for a *Recueil des poésies populaires de la France* to the philology section of the Committee on Literature, History, and Arts of France. Supported by a decree signed by Louis-Napoleon, this state-sponsored collecting project represented an attempt to consolidate a unified French cultural tradition through provincial song. In the grandiosity of this announcement lie hints of the project's eventual failure—the promised edition was never published. From its inception, the project contained contradictions: the material to be collected was termed "songs" (*chants*) or "poésies" interchangeably, while Fortoul celebrated France for possessing "precious remains of these poems, as much in the national language as in the provincial idioms that it has replaced"—already revealing tensions between centralization and regional difference.

Despite Napoleon's decree containing an article defining the types of songs to be included, this core issue became the central debate for the philology committee. The committee's president immediately asked: "What is the character of the *chants populaires* that are deemed suitable for inclusion in the poetry collection?" Jean-Jacques Ampère's commission soon produced the *Instructions relatives aux poésies populaires de la France* (1853), a 56-page document that became perhaps the project's most significant product. The committee first debated whether the collection would comprise only "chants," or would also include "poésies chantées" and "poésies récités"—revealing how the very nature of song was unstable. The committee also grappled with defining "popular" itself, eventually settling on the formulation of "anonymous poems composed by or for the people"—a telling ambiguity that mirrored Napoleon III's own attempt to reconcile institutional power with expansive political populism in the plebiscite that had just established the Second Empire.

I approach this ambiguity through Ernesto Laclau's concept of the "empty signifier," arguing that popular song was produced by a heterogeneous social terrain. Its production of a wider identity of popular music depended on meaning being transmitted through chains of equivalence whose emergent discursive construction crystallized particular claims in a unifying, coherent form. The referential vagueness of "popular" was not merely a linguistic failure but a productive ambiguity that allowed music to traverse multiple domains—a capacity that proved fundamental to the cultural terrain of the nascent Empire.

This theoretical approach departs from existing research that has treated the Fortoul project as merely the first stage in the history of folkloric French song, wherein the autonomy of *chanson populaire* supposedly derived from its distance from both politics and market exchange. Instead, I argue that the key feature of this "popular" music was precisely its ability to traverse these domains and create coherence between otherwise incommensurable social and political forces.

Simultaneous to this state project, commercial publishers were developing their own popular song collections that further complicated and enriched the category of the "popular." In 1853, Jean-Baptiste Wekerlin published the first volume of his *Échos du temps passé*, whose preface established a historical lineage: "many of these ancient airs are *chansons populaires*, so it is natural to follow them with some more modern *chansons populaires*." Wekerlin's modern selections included songs from Brittany, Franche-Comté, Normandy, and other regions, alongside "exotic" selections like a "chanson polonais" and a "chanson negre." Similarly, the Garnier Frères' illustrated *Chants et chansons populaires de la France* was reprinted throughout the 1840s-60s, becoming a commercial success that mediated between regional specificity and national legibility.

The transformations these songs underwent in their journey from field to salon reveal much about how "popular" music was constructed for urban consumption. For instance, Wekerlin's arrangement of the Breton wedding song "Chanson de la Mariée" (marked *Allegretto* in 6/8 time with elegant piano writing and clever harmonic touches) significantly differs from the field transcription made by collector Rousselot in Loudéac in 1855 (in 2/4 time marked *Andante* with a relentless, processional quality). Through such harmonization practices, modal rural tunes were translated into palatably exotic salon idioms, revealing how "authenticity" was mediated through metropolitan aesthetic values even as it was ostensibly preserved.

The political dimensions of this construction become most apparent when examining how certain songs traversed state, commercial, and domestic spheres. At Napoleon III's inaugural imperial ball at the Tuileries in 1853, Isaac Strauss conducted "Partant pour la Syrie," a *romance* composed in 1807 by Hortense de Beauharnais, the Emperor's mother. Observers variously described this piece as an "air" and a "marche officielle." That same year, the publisher Heugel printed a new luxury edition of twelve *romances* by Hortense, though significantly, this collection did not include "Partant"—the new anthem could already be found in the popular Garnier compendium "Chants et chansons populaires de la France." The elevation of this *romance* to national anthem status (replacing the republican-tainted "Marseillaise") demonstrates how the category of *chanson populaire* could be mobilized for imperial legitimacy.

These parallel initiatives—state collectanea, commercial publishing, and imperial ceremony—created what Isabelle Mayaud calls "the emergence of a canon of a French *chanson populaire*, the popular here being conflated with the national." Yet unlike the account offered by scholars such as Matthew Gelbart, who argues that the "folk" popular split off from both "art" music and commercial "popular" music in the mid-nineteenth century, I demonstrate that in the French context, no autonomous formalist paradigm dominated. Instead, the ambiguity of *musique populaire* created a flexible category that could incorporate both the ethnographic collection of rural traditions and the commercial circulation of salon music.

This chapter thus challenges mainstream schemas of nineteenth-century musical hierarchies, particularly the influential tripartite model of valorized folk, elevated art music, and denigrated commercial popular music. Rather than a residual category awaiting aesthetic elevation (the Herderian model), or merely the constitutive Other of elite music, the popular in Second Empire France constituted its own aesthetic repertoire—one that would continue to evolve as it traversed new domains of circulation, media, and political mobilization throughout the period covered in subsequent chapters.
