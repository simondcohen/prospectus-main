### Louis Rosenzweig (1830-1884) and the Fortoul Survey in a nutshell

- **Who he was.**
    
    Paris-born archivist-paléographe, appointed departmental archivist of Morbihan (Vannes) in 1855 and resident there until his death. [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Rosenzweig?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **When he entered the survey.**
    
    He was **not** in the first 1852–53 wave.  Rosenzweig joined a **late revival of the Ampère-Fortoul enquiry around 1869-70**, when the Ministry circulated fresh reminders asking provincial scholars to supply *airs* as well as texts.  His responses are dated 1870 on several Kan.bzh records
