General planning:

Gpt’s summray of laclau vs zizek: this could map on well to the dissertation, with the 4th chapter being the “act” that rewrites the coordinates

For Žižek, the “tear” is the point where our social stories stop—an inassimilable wound he calls **the Real**. Every slogan, coalition, or policy proposal sits on top of that wound, but none can suture it completely.  Confronting the tear, then, means refusing to pretend the wound isn’t there. It begins with **naming the hard antagonism**—for Žižek, the capitalist class relation—that keeps returning, disavowed, beneath more comforting narratives of “the people” or incremental reform. This is why he faults Laclau: an empty signifier like “democracy” can knit grievances together, yet it can just as easily slide into scapegoating unless someone insists, “the real problem is the structure that exploits us all.” [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ticklish_Subject.html?id=DCjQfHEJPaAC&utm_source=chatgpt.com)[JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/505378?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

But naming is only half the job. To “confront” the tear is finally to risk an **act**—a leap that rewrites the coordinates rather than juggling them.  Žižek borrows Lacan’s term *acte* for a moment when subjects step outside the symbolic web and force a new one: Lenin pushing beyond parliamentary compromise in 1917; civil-rights activists sitting where the law said they could not; climate strikers blocking traffic to say business-as-usual is over. Such acts are disruptive, never tidy, because they expose the gap the system tries to paper over.

What follows is not eternal chaos but a reopening of universal possibility: the chance to rebuild solidarity that isn’t grounded in an enemy scapegoat but in an equality the old order made unthinkable. In Žižek’s eyes, confronting the tear is thus the only way to stop a populist “people vs. elites” story hardening into new exclusions and instead push it toward a radically inclusive, class-conscious project.

Does that picture of the tear—and what it asks of political actors—clarify things? If you’d like, we can look at a concrete case or trace the idea through one of Žižek’s later books.
