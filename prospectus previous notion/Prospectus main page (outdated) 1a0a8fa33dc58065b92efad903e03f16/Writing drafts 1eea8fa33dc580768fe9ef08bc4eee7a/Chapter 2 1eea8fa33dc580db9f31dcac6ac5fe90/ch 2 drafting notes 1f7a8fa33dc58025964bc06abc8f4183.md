# Chapter 2 — 1858: Speculation, Piracy, and the Romance Economy

In the lavish catalog issued by Alfred Ikelmer & Cie for 1858-59, a curious composer named "Fugati" takes pride of place among the publisher's most prestigious musical acquisitions. On another page, works appear under the name "Remiehleki"—reverse the letters, and you have "Ikelmer." These thinly veiled pseudonyms did not escape the notice of A. Giacomelli, music critic for *La Presse Théâtrale et Musicale*, who gleefully exposed the deception in a scathing review. "There are conscientious publishers who bring to this kind of work as much intelligence as taste," Giacomelli wrote. "The Ikelmer and Co. publishing house is not among them." This public unmasking of an ambitious music publisher—whose enterprise was built on a foundation as spectral as some of its composers—opens a window into how "popular" music was increasingly financialized within the Second Empire's print marketplace, becoming a form of virtual capital circulating through networks of speculation and reproduction.

Ikelmer's firm, established just several years earlier, was one of many commercial publishing ventures competing for attention in Paris's musical print market. His catalog featured full-page advertisements for collections like "Chants nationaux du monde entier" (National anthems of the entire world), transcribed for piano by Louis Messemaeckers. Another page promoted the works of René Favarger, including his arrangements of "Partant pour la Syrie" and "God Save the Queen," which boasted impressive circulation figures of 8,000 and 8,400 copies, respectively—a transparent commercialization of patriotic sentiment through sheet music sales. These products exemplified how national identity itself was becoming a marketable commodity, with publishers tracking and promoting circulation figures as evidence of both commercial success and patriotic legitimacy.

Giacomelli quoted the catalog at length, mocking its grandiose claims—Étienne Arnaud was described as "the famous *romancier* whose works the entire universe sings and will sing." "It is thus well understood that the works of Étienne Arnaud are sung in the entire universe," Giacomelli wrote sarcastically, "which suggests that they are the delight of the Cochinchinos, the Kaffirs, and the Hottentots, an inappreciable distinction that must singularly flatter the famous *romancier*." When Ikelmer claimed that the compositions of "charming composer" Favarger "are admitted in all houses where there is a piano," Giacomelli responded with mock enthusiasm: "Lucky publisher, your fortune is made!" The critic even translated one of Ikelmer's more oblique sentences—"In our days one does not attach oneself to an author as one did in the past; it is rare to see a composer growing always in the spirit of the public; such is Favarger"—as meaning simply: "Favarger will never become a giant." Ikelmer's pseudonyms and his curious disavowal of authorial attachment inadvertently echo the valorization of anonymity that characterized the recent state-sponsored folkloric projects.

Yet despite this scathing critique, a curious reversal occurred less than a month later, when Giacomelli's publication featured a large banner advertisement for Étienne Arnaud's "Album de Chant," "en vente chez MM. Alfred Ikelmer." Above it appeared a short, positive review of Messemaeckers' "Chants nationaux" collection, calling the arranger "savant et inspiré" and crediting the "publishers [who] have chosen and grouped them with as much taste as discernment." This abrupt shift—from mocking the claim that Arnaud's romances would be "the delight of the Cochinchinos" to lauding the "authentic character" of Ikelmer's national songs collection—suggests how commercial pressure could quickly transform critical discourse into promotional material.

What readers of Giacomelli's publication couldn't know was that Ikelmer's impressive catalog had been largely acquired rather than built. Most of what he advertised had been purchased in 1855 when Alfred and his brother Joseph-Désiré launched their music publishing business alongside an export brokerage firm. This business was financed through dubious means—Alfred, while still employed by a manufacturer named Jouvin, had forged bills of exchange in its name and circulated them through Paris bankers. By 1858, Ikelmer had expanded his catalog by purchasing the complete "fonds" (tangible and intangible assets) of the struggling publisher Ledentu, appropriating that firm's prestigious salon repertoire as the foundation for his own music business. The "Chants nationaux" collection itself had appeared several years earlier under Ledentu's imprint.

While Ikelmer may have silenced Giacomelli through commercial leverage, he faced a more formidable opponent in journalist Jean-Louis-Auguste Commerson. In January 1858—the same month he acquired Ledentu's catalog—Ikelmer published a piano quadrille with music by Isaac Strauss titled "Les Binettes contemporaines." This title was lifted directly from a series of biographical sketches that Commerson had published several years earlier, and Ikelmer's edition also appropriated four caricatures by Nadar from Commerson's publication. Commerson swiftly sued in the Tribunal de commerce de la Seine, and in April 1857, the court ruled in his favor.

The judgment hinged on the principle that "a music publisher does not have the right to apply to quadrilles or other musical compositions the title adopted by an author for a literary publication." This ruling engaged two emerging legal frameworks: the law on trademarks (Marques de fabrique) enacted in 1857 and the concept of "concurrence déloyale" (unfair competition). Significantly, the court's judgment concerned not copyright violation per se (which didn't protect mere titles) but the commercial practice of competing through deception—misleading consumers by emulating familiar styles.

In his satirical publication *Le Tintamarre*, Commerson celebrated his victory in a column titled "Musique Frelatée" (adulterated music), writing that Ikelmer "without the slightest shame, made it reappear under the title: 'Contemporary Portraits,' right under the noses and before the very eyes of music hacks and piano plunkers who paid a second time for this repackaged product." Ikelmer was forced to withdraw the publication from the market. The legal distinction here is revealing: Ikelmer's transgression lay in appropriating Commerson's title and Nadar's portraits, while the musical content—Strauss's arrangement of themes from a féerie called "Les 500 diables"—remained unprotected common property.

In 1860, Ikelmer's financial scheme finally collapsed; his firm went bankrupt, and Alfred was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The bankruptcy assessment revealed 26,000 francs in printed music stock and shop fittings against 301,000 francs of liabilities across 40 creditors—a stark illustration of how the music publishing industry operated on speculative capital and unsustainable credit.

The skirmish between Ikelmer and Giacomelli superimposed a debate on musical value in print over a debate about music's financial value, while the Commerson lawsuit clarified the emerging legal frameworks surrounding musical property. The financialized system of property that blossomed in this period allowed entrepreneurs like Ikelmer to establish publishing houses practically overnight by capitalizing on the "fonds" of existing publishers—assets he acquired through exploitation of the banking system. Despite critical and legal challenges, the musical economy of 1858 operated on the principle that popular melodies constituted common property, while titles, texts, and images could be legally protected as commercial assets.

This asymmetry in intellectual property protection illustrates the paradoxical status of musical value in the period: while publishers competed to associate their editions with markers of authenticity and prestige, the actual musical content remained largely fungible and reproducible. The circulation of emblem tunes like "Partant pour la Syrie" and "God Save the Queen" through derivative arrangements exemplifies how national identity itself became a marketable commodity in this system. Publishers boasted of circulation figures while critics like Giacomelli mocked the pretense that such music could have universal appeal across colonial boundaries.

These tensions reflect larger contradictions within the Second Empire's cultural politics: between national particularity and cosmopolitan universalism, between authentic expression and commercial reproduction, between intellectual property and common cultural heritage. By examining how music was marketed, criticized, and litigated in this moment, we can observe how the category of the "popular" was constructed at the intersection of commercial, legal, and aesthetic discourses—continuing the process of consolidation begun with the state folkloric projects described in the previous chapter, but now primarily driven by market forces rather than official cultural policy.
