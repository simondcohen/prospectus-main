Schwartz, Stuart B. *Sea of Storms: A History of Hurricanes in the Greater Caribbean from Columbus to Katrina.* The Lawrence Stone Lectures. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2015. (esp chapter 5 for 1867 hurricane)

Schwartz uses the episode to press his larger argument: in the post-emancipation Caribbean, hurricanes became fiscal and moral audits of empire. They forced metropoles to tally the cost of distant possessions, spurred debates over insurance and public relief, and laid bare the racial hierarchies encoded in aid distribution. By the century’s end, he writes, the question was no longer whether storms were divine judgments but how far states should socialise the “risks of life,” a logic that would nurture the modern welfare—and, eventually, disaster-management—state.
