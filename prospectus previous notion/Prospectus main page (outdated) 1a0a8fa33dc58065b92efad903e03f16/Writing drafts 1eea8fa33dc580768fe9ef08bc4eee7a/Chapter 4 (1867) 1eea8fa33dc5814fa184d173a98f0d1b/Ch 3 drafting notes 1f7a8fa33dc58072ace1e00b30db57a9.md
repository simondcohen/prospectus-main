# Chapter 3 — 1867: Charity, Mechanical Media, and Colonial Relief

On January 2, 1867, the ground trembled beneath Algiers. An earthquake struck the colonial capital, causing serious destruction and widespread panic throughout the city. Nine months later and thousands of miles away, in October of the same year, a hurricane ravaged the Caribbean islands around St. Thomas, killing more than 600 people and creating tsunamis that wrecked large shipping vessels in this vital trading hub. "There is not a dwelling on the island that has not suffered. The small houses of the poor classes were leveled to the ground," wrote one dispatch. These distant catastrophes, linked by their occurrence in the same year, prompted similar responses in their respective colonial contexts: a flurry of musical charity events that reveal how popular music circulated as a form of humanitarian currency within imperial networks. These benefit performances open a window onto how mechanically reproducible music articulated relations between metropole and colony, between philanthropic sentiment and commercial entertainment, between collective sonic experience and colonial governance.

In the weeks following the Algiers earthquake, numerous organizations and societies announced charity concerts to benefit the victims. The daily newspaper *L'Akhbar* carried announcements for several events, including a benefit organized by the Société des Dames de Charité on January 11 at the Théâtre Impérial d'Alger, featuring a performance by Juliette Borghèse. Similar charitable impulses emerged in San Fernando following the hurricane, where the local gazette announced an "amateur concert" for the benefit of those suffering on neighboring islands. The organizers of both events seemed acutely aware of financial constraints. *L'Akhbar* announced that the Borghèse benefit raised 1,157 francs, an impressive sum given that "every purse is more or less drained—whether by New-Year gifts or by the urgent subscription drives to which everyone strives to contribute." The San Fernando Gazette conceded that "the charge of admission may appear high, and to some perhaps unreasonable, but when the object is understood, it is to be hoped that every one who really can, will patronize the meeting."

The programs for these events reveal much about how musical taste operated in colonial contexts. The benefit hosted by La Société des Dames featured *Les Dragons de Villars*, an 1856 opéra comique with music by Aimé Maillart. Borghèse had sung in the Parisian premiere at the Théâtre Lyrique, and the work had just finished a successful run at Algiers' main theater before being brought out of retirement for the charity performance. *L'Akhbar* noted the success but also chided the director Auguste Deloche dit Campocasso, a provincial French theater director new to Algiers, for reviving the production but never having scheduled it on a Sunday. The newspaper pointed out that "there exists here a portion of the population just as intelligent as the rest, and just as capable of appreciating good things, but who can go to the theatre only on Sundays because of their daily occupations." This remark gestures toward class tensions within the European colonial population, though it notably excludes the indigenous population entirely from the imagined audience.

The San Fernando benefit similarly reflected colonial musical taste, though filtered through British rather than French cultural frameworks. A program composed mostly of Victorian parlor songs was followed by a blackface performance by "Christie's Minstrels," modeled on the British troupes which were successfully but controversially mimicking American minstrel shows. The concert concluded with performances of "Partant pour la Syrie" and "God Save the Queen," the French anthem serving as a momentary acknowledgment of the islands' French-speaking population. Here, as in Algiers, we witness how national anthems and popular entertainments traveled along imperial circuits, creating sonic affiliations that both reinforced and complicated colonial hierarchies.

These musical events sat at a nexus of intersecting interests—operatic prestige imported from imperial capitals, philanthropic sympathy, gestures toward working-class Europeans, and the complete erasure of indigenous populations from the imagined community of both victims and benefactors. The performance of *Les Dragons de Villars* in Algiers represented a form of cultural capital flowing from metropole to colony, while the inclusion of both "Partant pour la Syrie" and "God Save the Queen" in San Fernando reflected the complex overlapping sovereignties in colonial contexts. In both cases, music served to mobilize charitable sentiment while simultaneously reinforcing the cultural authority of the colonizers.

The 1867 colonial charity performances occurred during a year of particularly heightened imperial spectacle. In Paris, the massive *Exposition Universelle* displayed the triumph of Second Empire industry, technology, and colonial power to millions of visitors. While the scale of the colonial charity events was far more modest, they similarly functioned as performances of imperial benevolence and technological prowess. The mechanical reproduction that allowed operatic scores and national anthems to circulate globally was itself a demonstration of the empire's reach—the ability to reproduce metropolitan musical culture in distant territories represented a form of what Chandra Mukerji would call "soft infrastructure" underpinning imperial authority.

The philanthropic deployment of popular music in colonial contexts can be productively contrasted with another musical economy operating in Paris during the same period: street musicians, particularly organ grinders. In his encyclopedic work on Paris, Maxime du Camp vividly describes these itinerant performers whose mechanical instruments disrupted the sonic order of the capital. Unlike the charity concerts that channeled musical affect toward approved humanitarian ends, organ grinders represented an unruly sonic presence that authorities struggled to regulate. The same mechanical reproducibility that allowed imperial anthems to circulate globally also enabled what was perceived as musical nuisance to proliferate in urban spaces.

This chapter argues that music was enlisted in forming an affective economy of popular sentiment within complex imperial infrastructures. While the *Exposition Universelle* offered the grandest display of Second Empire power in 1867, the charity concerts analyzed here reveal how even modest musical events depended on the affordances of a musical and affective style embedded in industrial technology, uncertain property regimes, and sentimental humanitarianism. By examining these performances at the imperial periphery alongside contemporaneous discussions of street music in the metropole, I illuminate how popular music's circulation contributed to what Jacques Rancière would call the "distribution of the sensible"—the aesthetic ordering that determines what can be perceived and who has the right to appear within a given social arrangement.

The contrasting cases of colonial charity concerts and metropolitan street musicians reveal the double-edged nature of mechanical reproducibility in Second Empire musical culture. The same technologies that enabled music to function as humanitarian currency in colonial contexts also facilitated forms of sonic disruption that challenged notions of appropriate musical consumption. Both cases demonstrate how the category of the "popular" continued to evolve from the state folkloric projects of the 1850s and the commercial print culture of the following decade into increasingly mechanized and global forms of circulation by 1867, setting the stage for the political fracturing that would occur with the Franco-Prussian War and Paris Commune just a few years later.
