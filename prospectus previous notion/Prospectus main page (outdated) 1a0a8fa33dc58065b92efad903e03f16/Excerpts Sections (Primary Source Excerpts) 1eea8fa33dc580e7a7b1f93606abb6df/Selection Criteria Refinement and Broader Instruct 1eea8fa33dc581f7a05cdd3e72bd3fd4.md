Source Type: Committee Minutes (government administrative document)
Notes & Description: Minutes from a special meeting showing the committee's continued refinement of selection criteria, rejecting most politically-oriented songs (about the Duke of Guise, Madame de Pompadour, etc.) and those of recent origin (a 1805 military song). The document also records discussion about developing more comprehensive instructions for correspondents covering all three domains of the philology section's work: language history, literary history, and history of philosophy and sciences.
