Notes & Description: Minutes from the second committee meeting, where Ampère presents the commission's progress on classification criteria for the popular poetry collection. The committee decides to replace the term "ballade" with "romance narrative" and to include example fragments with their instructions. Crucially, they resolve to organize the collection in three sections: poems in French, poems in regional patois/dialects, and poems in foreign languages from regions now part of France.
