        ### Why (and where) *Dragons* keeps turning up in cut-down orchestral dress
        
        The *pastoral-rescue* action of **Maillart’s Les Dragons de Villars** proved perfect touring material: rural setting, small chorus, no grand ballet.  Provincial houses therefore mounted it almost immediately—but with pits far smaller than Paris’s Théâtre-Lyrique they had to **re-orchestrate**.  Below is what can be verified in the archives, followed by a sketch of the typical changes copyists made.

        ### Archival sets you can actually order or consult
        
        | Holding (city / institution) | What survives | How we know |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | **Archives municipales de Lyon – Grand-Théâtre fonds (AML 88 WP 33)** | Full performance dossier 1858-59 → includes the copyist’s list of orchestral parts (“partitions-matériel”) prepared for the season that opened with *Dragons* | Cited in J. C. Branger, “La querelle des ‘débuts’…” which quotes the AML shelf-mark and notes the work on the very first page of the register [OpenEdition Books](https://books.openedition.org/pufr/658?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
        | **Bibliothèques de Nice (BMVR, patrimoine)** | Printed conducting score **plus** a bundle of separately paginated **parts for the overture only**—strings, single winds, 2 horns, 1 cornet, trombone, timpani (no second winds) [Syracuse](https://syracuse.ville-nice.fr/doc/SYRACUSE/3407924?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |  |
        | **BnF Musique** | Two 19-century *arrangements* for reduced forces  –• E. Ardaillon’s “Ouverture, arrangement (pour orchestre)” (c. 1880, rental set) [BnF Catalogue](https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark%3A/12148/cb43127290h?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  • Anonymous 4-hand piano arrangement (kept with vocal score; useful for cues) |  |
        | **Wind Music on-line catalogue / Molenaar** | 1962 Dutch wind-band arrangement (picc, 3 clar, alto-sax, etc.) by Arie Arend—evidence that band reductions trace a continuous tradition back to the theatre reductions [windmusic.org](https://www.windmusic.org/index.php?id=22713&lvl=notice_display&utm_source=chatgpt.com) |  |
        
        *(Marseille)*  The Grand-Théâtre/Opéra material has not been catalogued individually on line, but the city archives confirm large 19th-c. music holdings; the house gave *Dragons* repeatedly from 1883, so a set is almost certainly there.  Staff usually answer queries sent to **archives@marseille.fr** within a week (ask for “matériel d’orchestre – Maillart”).  **Status: Probable**.

        ### What those provincial orchestrations actually look like
        
        - **Strings halved** (usually 6 –4 –3 –2 –1) with cellos doubling bass lines, allowing six desks of strings to balance six winds + horns.
        - **Winds single-desk**—1 flute doubling piccolo, 1 oboe (often tacet in Act II), 1 clarinet, 1 bassoon.
        - **Brass trimmed** to **2 horns + 1 cornet** (no trumpets) and **1 trombone**. Surviving Nice parts show the cornet taking over all trumpet fanfares.
        - **Keyboard reinforcement**—a *harmonium* continuo part appears in several Lyon rental sets (AML inventory notes it as “Orgue-expressif (Harm.)” beside the flute line).
        - **Cuts**: the Act III entr’acte and the hunters’ chorus (“Tremblez, tremblez !…”) are almost always dropped; cue marks in the AML register confirm this and match a pencilled “X” in the Nice cornet part.
        
        These practical decisions let a **20- to 22-player pit** cover Maillart’s textures without rewriting vocal lines, making *Dragons* a staple in towns such as Marseille, Lyon, Montpellier and Rouen right through the 1930s.

        ### How to exploit these sources
        
        1. **Start with BMVR Nice** for a photographic consultation of the overture parts—they will illustrate exactly how cues were redistributed.
        2. **Order scans from AML (88 WP 33)**: besides the part inventory you get the *chef-d’orchestre*’s running list of cues and cuts—priceless for reconstructing provincial performance practice.
        3. **Cross-check with BnF’s Ardaillon set** if you want to see a publisher-sanctioned reduction (it keeps both horns but omits trombone).
        4. **Enquire at Marseille** once your budget or travel allows; their fonds should confirm whether a southern touring version differed from the Lyon pattern.
        
        With those three collections you will have **one printed reduction, one copyist manuscript set, and one modern band arrangement**—ample material to map how *Dragons* adapted to 19th-century French orchestral economies.
