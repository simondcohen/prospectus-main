If you just want one “canonical” place to see the chain-of-equivalence idea laid out from first principles, open ***Hegemony and Socialist Strategy* (1985; 2nd ed. 2000), chapter 3, “Beyond the Positivity of the Social.”**  It is here—pages 95-109 in the Verso edition—that Laclau and Mouffe spell out how disparate democratic demands can be stitched together through relations of *equivalence* (a shared “No!” to the status quo) while preserving their *difference* (each retains its own positive content).  The chapter also introduces the corollary notions of floating/empty signifiers and antagonism, so you get the whole conceptual toolkit in one tightly argued sequence.

If you want a slightly more compact reprise, Laclau’s essay “Structure, History, and the Political” in ***New Reflections on the Revolution of Our Time*** (1990) rehearses the same logic in about thirty pages and clarifies why an “equivalential chain” is the only way a plural society can produce a collective “people” without erasing difference.

Finally, ***On Populist Reason*** (2005) re-deploys the chain for a single purpose—explaining how populist movements cobble together heterogeneous grievances—and adds helpful concrete illustrations (e.g., French Jacobinism).  Read chapters 4–7 for the most polished, example-rich version
