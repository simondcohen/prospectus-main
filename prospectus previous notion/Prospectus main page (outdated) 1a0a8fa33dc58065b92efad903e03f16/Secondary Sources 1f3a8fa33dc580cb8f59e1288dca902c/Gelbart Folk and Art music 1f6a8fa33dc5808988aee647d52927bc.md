# Gelbart: Folk and Art music

Introduction

Patent, “objective” definitions of both folk and art music, whether by the IFMC, textbook authors, or anyone else, are doomed to inconsistency, tautology, and ultimately self-contradiction because folk music and art music are not timeless, objective truths, but very human constructions. Reminders from linguists and philosophers of language that signifiers gain their meaning from use and contrast take on crucial weight here. Especially relevant is Wittgenstein’s insistence that most terms encompass not single distillable essences but interlinked “family resemblances.” If, as Wittgenstein implies, definitions of almost any terms are complicated by this phenomenon, surely abstractions such as “folk music” and “art music” must be among the hardest to approach. However, we should not give up all attempts at pinning down the terms, as temptation may beckon."” The stakes are highest with the very

Folk music and art music, being recent constructions that have portrayed themselves as timeless categories, share much with the idea of “invented traditions.”’” 

**o understand fully the persistence and influence of these categories, we must not only recognize the fact that each is open to variations bearing loose “family resemblances,” we must also realize something that has not been considered much in the existing literature: the specific historical interdependence of “folk” and “art” as a binary, dialectical pairing.'” These signifiers have gained their referents through contrast and opposition to each other: throughout their history, the fact that “folk music” and “art music” have functioned in dialogue with each other has rendered their force exclusive rather than inclusive. Thus, for example, each criterion listed above as a potential defining feature of art music fails because it begins as an attempt to exclude specific kinds of music from the definition, and then cannot manage to keep out another specimen or kind of music that also does not “belong.” We end up with a group of definitions of what art music isn’t, not a single definition of what it is. A look at the problematic IFMC definition of folk music cited at length above shows that it works the same way: the boundaries of folk music are determined tautologically by opposition to art music (and here popular music as well).**

**ince folk music and art music came to exist only in relation to each other, the present study undertakes to “define” these labels by examining the history of their mutual dependence. T**

a long century later — in the mid-1800s — folk music and art music had acquired connotations more or less consistent with their present meanings. Additionally, by the midnineteenth century, the third category, popular music, had begun to establish itself — multiplying the possible combinations of binary and ternary oppositions through which both folk and art could henceforth

**The folk and art music categories have been transnational: by the midnineteenth century, every European nation had discovered its own “folk,” and ideas of timeless “art’’ masterpieces were establishing themselves across Europe and beyond.**

**en as it pushed that foundation down to a lower level discursively. Art music staked its claim to universality on the assertion that it synthesized national and pan-national folk collectives into individual works through the agency of the individual genius. To posit this process, composers and critics had to transform the qualities ascribed to folk music as “tradition” — especially genius, authenticity, and organicism into aesthetic terms they could access and integrate into their own work.**

nto aesthetic terms they could access and integrate into their own work. From this point, the modern interdependent categories were largely in place within Germany, and Chapter 7 follows up on their international spread and the lasting effects of their geographical connotations in this process.

**n the final chapter, I look at how “popular music” separated from folk and art music and became a third main grouping, effecting yet another slight adjustment of the folk and art categories and helping to solidify the terminology we use for the different domains. I have finished by considering how this state of affairs — standing much as it did in the 1850s — has implications today in our scholarship and our own musical world.**
