# Chapter 3 Reference

## Primary Sources

The parallel between newspaper and song is very clearly established by Alfred Assolant in his *Chronique de Cadet Borniche*.

**Alfred Assolant** - *Chronique de Cadet Borniche*, which began at the end of 1863: after lamenting the emptiness of certain song shows, the narrator, who advocates for the existence of "good taste popular scenes," asserts: "If drama or opera is a book, then the little comedy or the song would be a newspaper article" (January 4, 1864).

## Key Arguments/Questions

### Central Concept: "Trafic Honteux" (Shameful Traffic)

- Functions as both literal description (trafficking of Italian child musicians) and moral condemnation (commercialization of art)
- Links multiple forms of circulation anxiety: economic, bodily, gendered, racial
- Reveals 1863 as pivotal "sorting" moment determining legitimate vs illegitimate musical commerce

### Core Arguments

1. **Dual Strategy**: Criminalization and commercialization work as complementary mechanisms, not opposing forces

   - Police ordinance excludes disabled performers while café-concerts proliferate
   - Street music gets medicalized/criminalized while indoor venues get licensed/taxed

2. **Property Manifestations**: Music becomes property through regulatory mechanisms

   - Numbered medals make legitimate musical bodies visible
   - SACEM rights create new forms of musical ownership
   - Bodies themselves become rented instruments (child musician trafficking)

3. **Gendered Circulation**: Women's performance creates specific anxieties

   - *La Chanson* condemns singers using art as "pretext" for other commerce
   - Quête practice (collecting tips among tables) literalizes circulation fears
   - Potential overlap with prostitution surveillance systems

4. **Geographic Variations**: Port cities reveal racialized dimensions

   - Bordeaux: Edé's career navigating between Grand Théâtre and Alcazar
   - Marseille: Occitan repertoire and Mediterranean circulation
   - Colonial connections through port economies

### Research Questions

- How do moral and economic languages intertwine in regulatory documents?
- What specific mechanisms sort bodies/sounds into legitimate vs illegitimate categories?
- How do provincial authorities adapt or resist Parisian models?
- Where do racial categories intersect with musical regulation?
- What role do financial networks (shadow banking, instrument rental) play in sustaining illegal circulation?

## Methodological Frameworks

### From Abstract to Material

- Moving away from Laclau & Mouffe's abstract popular logic toward concrete economic/material history
- Sources themselves generate concepts rather than applying predetermined theoretical frameworks
- "Shameful traffic" emerges from periodical rhetoric, not imposed as analytical category

### Multi-Scalar Analysis

- **Regulatory**: Ordinances, licensing, surveillance create visible mechanisms
- **Economic**: Rental markets, shadow banking, rights disputes reveal financial infrastructure
- **Embodied**: Medals, medical exams, deportations show regulation at bodily level
- **Geographic**: Paris-provinces-colonies circulation patterns

### Temporal Convergence

- 1863 as specific moment when multiple systems align:
  - Police ordinance (February 18)
  - Café-concert expansion (Eldorado 1862, Alcazar operations)
  - *La Chanson* launch (November 1862)
  - Edé's career transition

### Source Integration

- Contemporary moral discourse (*La Chanson*)
- Administrative documentation (ordinances, licenses)
- Retrospective analysis (Du Camp 1873)
- Modern scholarship (Ellis, Darriulat) for context
- Archival materials to fill documentary gaps

### Chapter Architecture: "Sorting Carousel"

- Moral text (*La Chanson*) → Police regulation (medals/ordinances) → Market practice (Bordeaux/Italian circuits)
- Each mechanism shows how bodies/sounds get sorted into legitimate vs illegitimate categories
- Numbered medal as potential visual through-line
