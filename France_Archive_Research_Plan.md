## Critical Notes

- **AN closure**: Must complete ALL Archives Nationales work by August 1
- **Adjusted strategy**: Frontload AN, save BnF/Archives de Paris for closure period
- **Provincial timing**: Bordeaux could shift earlier or later depending on AN progress
- **Already completed**: Ikelmer bankruptcy photographed
