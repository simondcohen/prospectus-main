#### Key Economic Context

**Booming cheap-print economy KEY POINT!!!**

Garnier frères specialises in stereotype plates, bulk print-runs, and railway-bookstall pricing (the *loi du bon marché*). Delloye's elegant 1843 set was pricey and stalled when the 1848 crash hit; Garnier can now recycle the plates, strip the luxury, and court the enlarged lower-middle-class readership created by the literacy push of the 1830s–40s.

The huge page-count advertised in *Bibliographie de la France* is also a marketing flex: "all the songs you know (and many you don't) at a price you can now afford."

*(Further leads here include re-issues of Dumersan/Colet's lavishly illustrated **"Chants et chansons populaires de la France"**—new fascicles were still advertised in early 1853—and smaller provincial anthologies that piggy-back on the term. I can verify exact print runs if you wish.)*

These three witnesses are the same song in different guises:

1. **Source text & tune** = Fortoul manuscripts (Rousselot 1855).
2. **Scholarly transcript** = Bécam 1999 (text + melody).
3. **Arranged publication** = Weckerlin 1853 (voice + piano), derived from the folk original.

**Gérard de Nerval, "La Bohême galante," *L'Artiste* (July – Dec 1852).**\
Serialized travelogue where Nerval quotes and analyses *chansons populaires* from Valois, contrasting them with salon romance to argue for vernacular authenticity.

### Periodical Coverage

*Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris* and *Le Ménestrel* both announce Weckerlin's *Échos* and debate its "corrections" to raw melodies (early spring–summer 1853 issues). WorldCat and auction catalogues confirm the dating; I would locate the precise columns next.

## Working Notes & Questions

## Archive Access & Practical Information

## Theoretical Framework

- **Cultural and Political Context of Chansons:** Authorities regarded *chansons* as potentially subversive: they could spread dissent, satire, or news beyond the reach of censorship. The law's explicit mention of "chansons" underscores official anxiety about their power in public opinion and popular culture.

- **Dual Circulation Networks:** Under the same 1852 decree, Paris became the bottleneck for approval and stamping, while the provinces were left to license, watch and (often vainly) police a much more informal, small-scale trade. For song-printing that meant a legal, heavily policed **Parisian circuit** of fresh repertoire, and a looser **provincial circuit** where old favourites or harmless practical pieces circulated with minimal or no paperwork. The difference only disappeared after the 1870 amnesty and, above all, the 29 July 1881 press-freedom law, which finally abolished the timbre bleu for most printed matter.

- **Print vs. Performance Regulation:** Printed songbooks were policed far less strictly than cafés-concert or street singing. Dupont's most incendiary tune (*Chant des ouvriers*) could appear in elegant print (1855) while remaining barred from public performance until 1869. The regime counted on limited readership and the absence of the sung melody to blunt the text's mobilising power. **Probable** (Darriulat, *La chanson politique*, 2004).

## Core Arguments

**Music—specifically song sheets (*chansons*)—was explicitly and centrally involved in the scope of the 1852 "timbre du colportage" law.**

1. **The Law's Text:** The *Loi du 17 juillet 1852* expressly cites "chansons" (songs) among the types of printed materials subject to the special *colportage* stamp.

2. **Targeted Genres:** The law applied not just to pamphlets or political literature, but specifically to **song sheets**—the printed, cheaply produced lyrics (sometimes with musical notation) sold on the street or by peddlers, often recounting news, crimes, political events, or satirical material.

3. **Implementation and Effects:**

   - Printers and colporteurs of song sheets were required to affix the *timbre du colportage* to each sheet; failing to do so could lead to seizure or prosecution.
   - As a result, the cost and risk of disseminating such material increased, dampening the spontaneous circulation of topical songs.
   - Notably, some forms of *colportage* persisted clandestinely, but the overall flow of street-sold song sheets was reduced, especially those with controversial or topical content.

## Key Secondary Sources

- "La loi de 1852... frappa tout particulièrement les complaintes et chansons populaires, qui faisaient partie de la littérature de colportage." (Guérin, *La police de la presse sous le Second Empire*, 1904, p. 215 — Verified)
- See also: J.F. "Maxou" Heintzen, "La complainte criminelle," in *Criminocorpus* (2011), which discusses how the *colportage* stamp specifically restricted the market for printed street songs.
- **Patrice Coirault's filing cabinet**: in the 3-volume *Répertoire des chansons françaises de tradition orale* (1996-2007) and, more explicitly, in the huge 2020 edition of his *Répertoire des timbres* (BnF), every melodic **timbre** entry lists all the sources where it turns up — including *feuilles de colportage* stamped with the blue tax mark. **\[Verified\]**
