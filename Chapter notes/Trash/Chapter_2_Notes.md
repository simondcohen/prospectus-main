### Research Landscape

#### Publishing Industry Context

**Garnier Brothers Global Network**

**Baptiste-Louis Garnier** - Auguste and Hippolyte's younger brother opened *Livraria Garnier* on Rua do Ouvidor (later Rua Sete de Setembro) in 1858; within decade became Brazil's premier publisher-bookseller. Rio house printed locally but continued sending Brazilian manuscripts to Paris for typesetting on better machinery, then re-imported sheets for domestic binding - practice Baptiste boasted of in prospectuses aimed at Emperor Pedro II's court.

**Revista Popular (1859-1862)** - Launched January 1859 by Livraria e Casa Editorial Garnier as direct channel to customers, strategy to broaden readership in competitive market.

#### Theatre Economics and Crisis

**Theatre Lyrique Financial Crisis - Faust Overspend**

**Deficit warning lights** - Overspend on *Faust* left Carvalho personally exposed; within twelve months (1 Apr 1860) he resigned under mounting debts - first sign that Lyrique's golden run rested on very fragile economics.

**Key source**: *Revue des Deux Mondes*, 1 April 1859, "Faust de Gounod" (subsidy rant) - possibly actually March 1st.

#### Publisher Case Studies

**Ledentu Collapse**

**Émile-Guillaume Ledentu** - Paris house at 6 boulevard des Italiens, 1840s-60s. Specialized in booming salon market: romances, dance pieces, pedagogical "methods." By mid-1850s still solvent enough to pay pianist-entrepreneur **Henri Herz** lifetime annuity of 1,000 fr. for rights to Herz's *Méthode nouvelle*.

**High-risk catalogue strategy** - Steady stream of light piano repertory (Messemaeckers Op. 83, 85, etc.) through 1856-57, but titles sat in saturated market where German reprints flooding Paris at cut-rate prices. Cash outlay for plate engraving plus Herz's annuity left firm thinly capitalized. Unsold stock piled up while plate numbers multiplied - classic mid-tier over-extension.

**Legal slide 1857-1861**:

- April-May 1857: Commercial court notices show Ledentu dissolving earlier limited partnership, re-registering firm with É-G Ledentu as *seul associé responsable* - almost always pre-bankruptcy maneuver to protect outside investors
- **16 April 1857**: Notarial notice formally constitutes Ledentu's new joint-stock company "Société de l'Univers musical" (deed signed 1 April, recorded 21 April by notaries Potier de la Berthellière)
- **Structure**: Business trades as "Em. Ledentu & Cie"; Ledentu receives 150 fully-paid shares plus 20% of future profits as management fee for transferring existing catalogue
- **1861**: Tribunal de commerce placed house in liquidation; plate stock broken into lots

**Ikelmer acquisition** - Ikelmer's *Almanach illustré de musique* (1866) boasts firm had "racheté plusieurs fonds (*Benacci, **Ledentu**, Prosper Godet*)" - smoking gun that Ikelmer bought big slice of Ledentu catalogue at liquidation sale.

### 

#### Composer Mobility - Arnaud Case Study

**Timeline**:

- **Early 1850s**: Arnaud one of Ledentu's reliable romance composers
- **1856-59**: Ikelmer negotiates directly with Arnaud to re-engrave/over-stamp fresh pieces; splashy "Album de chant 1859" suggests personal inducement (higher royalty? better promotion?)
- **Post-1862**: When Ledentu estate liquidated, Ikelmer buys whole block, securing not just Arnaud's older best-sellers but trove of plates for cheap re-issue (sudden flood of Ikelmer reprints bearing Arnaud's name in early 1860s)
- **1863**: Arnaud dies

#### Legal Precedents

**"500 Diables" Quadrille vs. Vaudeville (c.1858-59)** - Around same time as Commerson v. Ikelmer, another dispute from Commerson's theatrical work *Les 500 diables* (vaudeville hit at Palais-Royal). Music publisher issued *Quadrille des 500 Diables* to capitalize on play's success.

**Tribunal ruling** - Differed from Binettes case: held that simply publishing songs from performed vaudeville was not outright "contrefaçon." Logic: play's songs (often set to well-known tunes) already in public's ear; printing as sheet music didn't violate author's rights if melodies not original. However, title "500 Diables" was play's hallmark - court cautioned against using play's exact title in misleading way.

**Legal nuance**: Lyrics/tunes from stage show might slip into public domain upon performance, but show's title still carries proprietary weight.

#### Musical Theatre Research Trends

**Richard Sherr's work** - Examined music for revues de fin d'année at Variétés: *Ohé! les p'tits agneaux!* (1857) and *As-tu vu la comète, mon gas?* (1858). Found scores consisted of mostly pre-existing music.

**Féerie bibliography** - Roxane Martin lists 13 full scores/complete sets of parts dating 1798-1843, plus Adolphe d'Ennery's *Faust* (1856). Fonds Variétés and fonds Ambigu-Comique have parts for *Le Petit Poucet* (1845) and *L'étoile du berger* (1846).

**Jean-Claude Yon** - Examined manuscript vocal score for Second Empire féerie *Rothomago* (1862).

### Research Priorities

**Research angle**: Check "Journal de la librairie" weekly for late 1859 for Paris houses announcing transfers of copyright and remaining stock.

**Research leads**: Ledentu's 1861-62 bankruptcy proceedings (Archives commerciales de la Seine, series 7Q3, files 167 ff.) may list exact sale price and lot numbers.

#### Song Journalism - Second Empire Publications

During Second Empire, 1858 saw appearance of *Le Bon Diable*, which in 1859 adopted subtitle "journal de la chanson," and *Paris chanté*, artistic literary, poetic, and commercial song journal. Also *La Chanson: journal hebdomadaire de critique littéraire et musicale: programme des concerts et cafés-concerts* (1862–1863) and *La Chanson illustrée* (weekly, 1869–1870).
