## Primary Sources

### Research Landscape

#### Imperial Crisis and State Responsibility

**Post-emancipation Caribbean context** - In post-emancipation Caribbean, hurricanes became fiscal and moral audits of empire. They forced metropoles to tally the cost of distant possessions, spurred debates over insurance and public relief, and laid bare the racial hierarchies encoded in aid distribution.

**Broader implications** - By century's end, the question was no longer whether storms were divine judgments but how far states should socialise the "risks of life" - a logic that would nurture the modern welfare and, eventually, disaster-management state.

**Research relevance** - 1867 hurricane provides framework for understanding how imperial crises forced debates about state responsibility, social welfare, and colonial management - themes that resonate with metropolitan cultural politics of the same period.
