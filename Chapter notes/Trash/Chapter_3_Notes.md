#### Café-Concert and Theatre Conflicts

**Bordeaux (1862-63)** - The Grand-Théâtre's manager Biche-Latour tried to open a café-concert annex; the rival Alcazar's director Martial Léglise lobbied the prefect to block it – an early sign that light entertainment was eroding the subsidised operatic monopoly.

**Marseille & Rouen (1860-63)** - Opera impresario Olivier Halanzier fought similar battles, seeking municipal exclusivity against encroaching cafés-concerts.

#### Complainte Production Process

**Who actually *made* a complainte?**

- **Text & sheets:** drafted (often anonymously) by hack writers, set in type by specialised presses, then stamped by the *Commission d'examen des livres du colportage*. A finished broadside cost c. 10 centimes and could be printed by the thousand. Darriulat notes, for example, the 1864 *Grande complainte de Jacques Latour* sold at that price.

- **Melody:** almost always a recycled hit ("Air : Fualdès", "Air : Malbrough"), so no notation had to be printed.

#### Edmond Dédé - Career Trajectory

From Ellis, *French Musical Life* (Chapter 7):

"Bordeaux provides an even more striking case in the person of Edmond Dédé, a free African American from New Orleans and Paris-trained composer, violinist, and conductor, who wrote two ballets mounted at the Grand-Théâtre (Nénéha, 1863, and La Sensitive, 1877) while remaining professionally active in both the opera and café-concert sectors. Around 1865—coinciding with the liberté des théâtres—Dédé moved from being the Grand-Théâtre's ballet répétiteur to conducting the orchestra at the Alcazar café-concert and writing chansons, managing the Café-Delta (1870), moving to Algiers as solo violinist at the Grand-Théâtre, working at the Marseille Casino, and returning to Bordeaux (the Alcazar and the FoliesBordelaises, around 1880)." (p. 204-205)

Career involved spells in Paris, Rouen, and Angers before settling in Bordeaux.

#### Worker Protection Movement

**(P)** *Towards a welfare net.* The hardships above fed directly into the founding (Feb 1865) of the **Union des artistes lyriques des cafés-concerts**, the first mutual-aid society for this milieu. The preparatory petitions begin in 1863.

#### Research Questions

1. **Wage scales below the star level.** Police licence renewals (AN F²¹ 1330-1345) include itemised budgets that should corroborate the anecdotal 3–5 fr cachets.

2. **SACEM licence registers (1858-65).** Annual lump-sum agreements will quantify each hall's music budget and show how enforcement worked outside Paris.

3. **Artist mobility maps.** Tracking names across the *Almanach des spectacles* (1862-63) and provincial playbills could visualise the café-concert network in real time.

**Alfred Assolant** - *Chronique de Cadet Borniche*, which began at the end of 1863: after lamenting the emptiness of certain song shows, the narrator, who advocates for the existence of "good taste popular scenes," asserts: "If drama or opera is a book, then the little comedy or the song would be a newspaper article" (January 4, 1864).

### Periodical Coverage

#### Song Journalism - Second Empire Publications

During the Second Empire, 1858 saw the appearance of *Le Bon Diable*, which in 1859 adopted the subtitle "journal de la chanson," and *Paris chanté*, an artistic literary, poetic, and commercial song journal. There was also *La Chanson: journal hebdomadaire de critique littéraire et musicale: programme des concerts et cafés-concerts* (1862–1863) and *La Chanson illustrée* (weekly, 1869–1870).

The parallel between newspaper and song is very clearly established by Alfred Assolant in his *Chronique de Cadet Borniche*.
