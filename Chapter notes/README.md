# Chapter Notes - Organizational Structure Guide

## Overview

This folder contains research materials organized by chapter, corresponding to the chronological structure of the dissertation. Each chapter focuses on a specific year or period in the Second Empire (1853-1870).

## Standard Folder Structure

All chapter folders should follow this consistent organizational structure:

### Core Folders (Required for each chapter)

1. **Archival Materials**
   - Original archival documents, manuscripts, and raw archive photos
   - Unpublished materials from archives (BnF, AN, etc.)
   - Court documents and legal proceedings
   - Business records and personal papers
   - Handwritten documents and correspondence

2. **Primary Sources**
   - Published books, periodicals, and printed materials from the period
   - Newspapers and journals
   - Government publications and official documents
   - Theatrical programs and announcements
   - Contemporary literary works

3. **Scores**
   - Musical notation and sheet music
   - Published musical scores with notation
   - Song collections and songbooks (with or without musical notation)
   - Orchestral and theatrical scores
   - Manuscript music (if notated)
   - Text-only songbooks and lyrics collections

4. **Secondary**
   - Scholarly articles and books about the period
   - Modern historical analyses
   - Theoretical and methodological texts
   - Recent dissertations and theses
   - Contemporary scholarship on 19th-century culture

5. **Working Notes**
   - Research notes and annotations
   - Draft materials and chapter outlines
   - Analysis documents
   - TOCs for processing
   - Personal research reflections

## Chapter Structure

- **Chapter 1 (1853)** - Folk song collection initiatives and cultural policy
- **Chapter 2 (1858)** - Music publishing and copyright disputes
- **Chapter 3 (1863)** - Urban soundscapes and street music
- **Chapter 4 (1867)** - International exhibitions and cultural exchange
- **Chapter 5 (1870)** - War, siege, and political song
- **Uncat:general** - Uncategorized materials spanning multiple chapters or awaiting classification

## File Organization Principles

### Naming Conventions
- Archival materials: `[Year]_[Collection]_[Archive]`
- Published sources: Original titles (preserve BnF catalog numbers when available)
- Working documents: Descriptive names for easy identification
- Avoid special characters that might cause system issues

### Special Collections
- Large thematic collections (e.g., Ikelmer in Chapter 2) may remain grouped together within their appropriate category
- Create sub-folders within categories when dealing with numerous related items
- Maintain original archival folder structures when relevant for research

### What Goes Where?

**Archival Materials vs. Primary Sources:**
- If unpublished/manuscript → Archival Materials
- If published/printed → Primary Sources
- Court documents → Archival Materials (unless published proceedings)

**Scores vs. Primary Sources:**
- If it's a songbook or song collection → Scores (regardless of notation)
- If it contains musical content or lyrics → Scores
- Literary works about music → Primary Sources

**When Uncertain:**
- Prioritize the primary function/format of the document
- Consider how you'll use it in your research
- Maintain consistency within collections

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Creating New Chapters:**
   - Copy the folder structure from Chapter 1 or 2
   - Create all five core folders even if initially empty
   - Add a chapter-specific README

2. **Adding Materials:**
   - Place in the most appropriate category folder
   - Create sub-folders for large collections
   - Update the chapter README with significant additions

3. **Regular Cleanup:**
   - Move misplaced files to correct folders
   - Delete empty folders (except core structure)
   - Update READMEs to reflect current contents

4. **README Files:**
   - Each chapter should have its own README
   - Document key themes and collections
   - Note any deviations from standard structure
   - Include helpful context for future reference

5. **Handling Uncategorized Materials:**
   - Use Uncat:general for materials that span multiple chapters
   - Place items here temporarily while determining proper classification
   - Review periodically and move items to appropriate chapters
   - Document any permanent cross-chapter collections

## Version Control Notes

- This structure was established June 2025
- Based on the reorganization of Chapters 1 and 2
- Designed for clarity, consistency, and research efficiency
- Flexible enough to accommodate diverse materials while maintaining order
