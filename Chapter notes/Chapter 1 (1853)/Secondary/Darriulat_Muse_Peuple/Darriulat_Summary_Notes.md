### Section: "Modes de diffusion" (pp. 212-220)
<!-- Section on modes of dissemination of popular song -->

This section examines the various modes through which popular songs circulated in 19th-century France, distinguishing between oral and written dissemination. Darriulat emphasizes that songs were fundamentally meant to be sung, with orality being central to the medium's nature. The section traces how songs spread through networks of former soldiers, itinerant singers, migrant workers, and compagnons on their Tour de France. It documents the extraordinary national success of certain songs like "Ulysse et Télémaque" (tracked across 30 departments between August 1851 and March 1852) and discusses how songs were modified during their circulation. The section then transitions to examining written forms of dissemination, particularly through colportage, noting the significant increase in printed song sheets during the July Monarchy and Second Republic.
