### Modes de diffusion (pp. 212-224)

politics in these verses, if not a panegyric of the emperor written on the occasion of the Exposition of 1855 and several couplets of ardent patriotism.

#### Modes of Diffusion

##### The Oral (pp. 212-217)

A song is made to be sung. Even when it is written, indeed printed, its purpose is always to be heard. This affirmation which seems obvious indicates to us clearly that orality is in the very nature of this medium. The construction of couplets, written in fairly short verses with the presence of repetitive refrains that aid memorization, as well as the habit, at least until the fashion of the cafés-concerts, of performing them to known tunes, obviously facilitate this mode of diffusion. At the same time, the abundance of song production makes the systematic use of print totally impossible. When Théophile Dumersan tries to quantify the repertoire of Parisian goguettes alone, he arrives at an annual production of three hundred thousand titles.<sup>241</sup> Even if this figure must be debated, it allows us to understand to what extent the immense majority of couplets could never have been published, without necessarily remaining confined within the walls of the venue where they were presented. Many contemporaries have moreover sought to demonstrate that the art of song is the most popular form of intellectual creation because it would be accessible to the illiterate. Additionally, to escape the vigilance of censors, authors of political songs may hesitate to print their productions.

The control of what is heard therefore has an importance as great as that of the written word. Without claiming to establish general statistics, it is possible to take some samples: considering only the general correspondence of the criminal division of the Ministry of Justice, we can count 121 cases concerning songs; in 87 cases these involve prosecutions brought against singers, the other 34 occurrences referring to the circulation of printed texts.

To try to better understand this diffusion, it is undoubtedly useful to take a specific example: that of the Bonapartist song *Ulysse et Télémaque*, mentioned for the first time on August 2, 1817, by the prefect of Haute-Garonne.<sup>242</sup> The files preserved in the National Archives provide us with valuable information about its circulation.<sup>243</sup> First of all, we must note its extraordinary national success: between August 1818 and March 1820, it is reported, directly or indirectly, in some thirty departments well distributed across the entire territory, evidently without its lyrics ever having been printed. First sung by former soldiers of the Empire,<sup>244</sup> this song then circulates thanks to a traveler, two itinerant singers, a student... all traditional agents of song diffusion, as well as of information and rumor.

Former soldiers, particularly during the Restoration, are men who often move about and have built solid networks of friendship and complicity. Itinerant singers, for their part, ensure transmission to the departments of tunes created in Paris, notably in the goguettes. In Alsace, for example, two of them, arrested in February 1822 for having performed *La Naissance des lauriers* and other seditious songs, affirm that they are part of a group of about a hundred Parisian singers. All sing the same songs in the neighborhoods of the capital during summer and, as winter approaches, they separate, each having to follow an itinerary to travel from town to town, village to village, and fair to fair.<sup>245</sup> The importance of the route taken by the musicians arrested in Nancy—Normandy, Picardy, Flanders to go to Brussels, Mons, Arras, Compiègne, Soissons, Laon, Reims, Châlons, Vitry, Bar-le-Duc, Ligny, Commercy, Toul and Nancy—testifies to the scope of this type of diffusion. Parisian street singers and itinerant singers are thus often the same characters who participate in the propagation, in the national language, of fashionable tunes in the streets of the capital; through this means they promote a certain homogenization of tastes, references, even opinions. It also happens that itinerant singers turn to songwriters they know to compose a few original titles for them. Claude Genoux thus writes in Marseille, for the singers of the port and the peddlers of the countryside, songs that are paid to him at three francs,<sup>246</sup> and Louis Guyon speaks of a certain Rougemaitre who would have been the preferred supplier of Parisian street singers during the Restoration.<sup>247</sup>

Migrant workers, like the masons from Creuse,<sup>248</sup> and journeymen performing their Tour de France, constitute other categories of population ensuring the oral diffusion of refrains.

Sometimes, these nomadic songs are modified during their peregrinations; these are then deformations that, in general, testify to the vicissitudes of a text transmitted by word of mouth, without necessarily changing its content. A finding confirmed in 1867 by Charles Nisard who, after having insisted on the importance of conscripts in the national diffusion of songs, notes that they must constantly adapt to their new audience and thus undergo: "a more or less radical transformation."<sup>249</sup> This is the case, for example, with this refrain from the July Monarchy that promises Louis-Philippe the punishment of parricides: in the first versions, the king of the French is presented as a "tyrant," in 1837 he has become a "damned brigand."<sup>250</sup>

However, not all songs have experienced as widespread a diffusion as the few examples cited so far. In fact, in their great majority, they never left the circle where they were born. Political songs, when they are composed and adopted by local networks, do not necessarily escape this rule. It should be noted that these compositions, because they address people who know each other, are always designed to be diffused exclusively orally, and sometimes in regional languages.

The impact of song diffusion by word of mouth cannot however be measured by considering only refrains that have never been published. It is certain that many printed songs were known to many French people solely because they had been heard and, partially or entirely, learned. Conversely, oral circulation is not always opposed to elementary forms of writing. It frequently happens that heard lyrics are copied down; this is then only an aid to memorization, the writing not being intended, in this case, to pass from hand to hand. Police and justice files are quite rich in pieces of this nature: reference has already been made to this Versailles junk dealer calling upon a public writer to fix the words of the song ridiculing Charles X by comparing him to a giraffe; one could also cite this shoemaker from Melle who carries on him the text of *Les Aristas* by Gustave Leroy, copied by his own hand, with approximate spelling and sometimes even purely phonetic.<sup>251</sup> Handwritten songs can also circulate through simple correspondence, a fairly widespread usage in the army between soldiers of different garrisons: this is how, for example, *Ulysse et Télémaque* was introduced into the department of the Seine.

State control of songs circulating orally is not an easy thing. As we have seen, to protect themselves, potential offenders have a whole arsenal of tricks or protections, and when an arrest takes place, the facts are difficult to establish. Moreover, when sung by men often suspected of not being able to understand their meaning, or by public singers assimilated to beggars, they benefit from a certain clemency from judges who fear that the incriminated words, when read in session, might provoke the joy of the audience and ridicule the court.

##### The Written (pp. 217-224)

If word of mouth remains the main mode of circulation of sung speech, the 19th century is nonetheless a privileged period for the diffusion of printed songs.

Since Béranger and the main successes of the Caveau moderne or vaudeville, "fashion" now clearly touches a form of expression that had until then been rather assimilated to tradition; it even becomes common to encounter memoirists who date an event by relating it to the tunes heard in the streets that year. Public expectations, the success encountered by certain authors, the multiplication of singing societies and shows, the habit taken by street singers of performing recent titles... are all elements that create a strong demand to which very numerous songwriters, sometimes famous, respond. The proposed couplets must then circulate quickly and be able to be renewed regularly: two objectives that only print allows to achieve. The primacy accorded to lyrics over music, requiring more sophisticated printing methods and addressing a more restricted audience, facilitates this process which continues to grow.

From the Restoration onwards, a very significant number of printed booklets can be counted. In the great majority of cases these are singing almanacs or collections produced by the Caveau or a provincial society constituted on its model. Titles with a pronounced political or social tone are very rare there; in this register the oral still dominates very largely. Despite some exceptions, like the works of Béranger and Debraux or the *Étincelles* of Pradel, political song is not yet "mediatized." It is under the July Monarchy that the phenomenon gains momentum. From the day after the Three Glorious Days, hundreds of brochures, proposing praise of the Parisian insurrection or updating the great hymns of the French Revolution, are presented to the public. The law on public criers of 1834 and those of September 1835 slow down, without ever making disappear, this production which starts up again with renewed vigor under the Second Republic. The abundance of leaflets diffusing partisan songs is such during this period that one can consider mediatized song as being then essentially political. After the coup d'état, republican or socialist leaflets disappear or are condemned to circulate clandestinely. However, public expectations, the creation of SALEM, the importance of literary peddling, are all elements that favor maintaining at a very high level the number of printed song publications each year. Among them, compositions glorifying the regime and those proposing a very critical picture of society regarding certain behaviors or certain social categories are very numerous.

Songs, sometimes decorated with a fairly crude illustration, are most often published at the author's expense on poor quality paper and sold for a negligible price, generally ten centimes. It also happens that several titles are grouped on the same sheet printed at the lowest cost, choosing the smallest possible characters in order to reproduce the maximum text without increasing expenses. Deposited with booksellers, music merchants or reading rooms, these booklets are easily accessible. Offering a very cheap product in order to seduce a popular audience is the rule for this type of publication and it seems relevant to link the development of song to that of popular books and publishing.<sup>252</sup> Print runs are however quite limited, generally between 1,000 and 3,000 copies, sometimes less,<sup>253</sup> without this allowing us to really measure the impact of titles then performed before a more or less wide audience.

The booklets essentially contain drinking songs, bawdy or anecdotal ones; however, political and social songs constitute a subset that is far from negligible and that can be estimated at a quarter of overall production. The nature of the refrains moreover seems to have no influence on the presentation of the printed object and it is common for the same sheet to group couplets belonging to different genres.

The diffusion channels of these texts are not always different from those used by songs that circulate by word of mouth. There too, it seems that populations accustomed to travel have had an important role: soldiers changing garrison, traveling salesmen or, like Martin Nadaud's father,<sup>254</sup> seasonal migrant workers.

Most texts however circulate thanks to two major agents of diffusion: the peddler and the public singer.

We have already seen how the latter, to supplement their meager income, make available to their audience leaflets containing the lyrics of the tunes they perform. Taking advantage of the absence, until 1851, of recognition of literary property, these singers will often seek in the goguettes the texts they then present on street corners. A habit that moreover does not totally disappear after the creation of SACEM. Eugène Baumester thus published several booklets that popularize refrains written by goguette songwriters: from 1832 he offers, with his father whom he accompanies at the beginning of his career, a first booklet<sup>255</sup> followed by many others, and from 1850 to 1874 he publishes, first with E. Vert then at the Moquet printing house, a series of forty-seven twelve-page in-12° brochures. It also seems, at least this is what emerges from the interrogation of singers arrested in Nancy, that real networks are set up: certain publishers publishing, for the exclusive use of itinerant singers, collections that are not necessarily sent to legal deposit. If political songs can circulate through these public singers, the networks mobilized cannot therefore be assimilated to those used by "parties."

Street singers must above all seduce an audience that allows them to survive more or less well. When they choose the titles they perform and distribute, they especially seek to anticipate the expectations of their audience to obtain the best gain. The patriotic songs with Bonapartist accents heard during the Restoration tell us more about the persistence of a strong national feeling in part of popular opinion than about the convictions of the mountebanks traveling the roads of France. Béranger's tunes circulate first because they allow hope for an appreciable income. It is moreover common for itinerant singers to offer refrains likely to satisfy the expectations of audiences with very different feelings. In July 1829 a group of musicians is denounced for having performed couplets "relating to the memory of Bonaparte." The booklet they distribute—*Chansons chantées par Degres, et son épouse, syndic des joueurs d'orgues*—is, in fact, a heterogeneous mixture of drinking songs, one frankly bawdy text, others very patriotic, but also a tribute to the memory of the Duke of Berry.<sup>256</sup> In March 1832, Joseph Gravier performs in Toulon the songs from a brochure containing both the Bonapartist refrains of *Le Manteau de Napoléon* and those, very legitimist, of *Le Vin de Bordeaux*.<sup>257</sup>

The main distributor of printed songs remains however the peddler. The latter spreads in the towns and villages of France a considerable number of diverse publications among which song occupies a preponderant place. It is however very difficult to establish statistics on the nature of the writings that fill the bundles of these itinerant merchants. Peddling works are, indeed, subject to no specific control until the circulars of July 28 and September 12, 1852 requiring them to be stamped by a special commission. Previous regulations are only interested in peddlers and not in the texts they offer.<sup>258</sup>

Before 1852, we can therefore only estimate the place of song in peddling literature based on seizures of works condemned by justice alone, prefects' reports and contemporaries' testimonies. After this date, information is, in fact, hardly more precise. Most of the archives of the stamping commission have indeed been lost.<sup>259</sup>

Despite all these difficulties, it is however possible to try to measure the importance of song in peddling literature.

Under the Second Empire, first of all, we have some numerical data. In Haute-Vienne, Alain Corbin has shown that songs represented 30% of printed matter distributed by peddlers between April 1853 and October 1855.<sup>260</sup> More generally, we have preserved the statistics of the stamping office for the months of November and December 1867.<sup>261</sup> The printed matter submitted to it are classified into five categories: "books," "booklets," "engravings," "almanacs," and "songs and sheets." This last group is by far the most important: 365,392 stamps granted out of a total of 654,947 (55.8%) in November and 236,015 out of 485,160 (48.6%) in December. It is obviously very difficult to differentiate "sheets" from "songs" in order to relativize the place of the latter. We can however note that "sheets" concern only the single publisher Roger who nevertheless represents 47.2% of all stamps granted in the "songs and sheets" category. Moreover, we find songs among the other groups established by the stamping office. Collections of works by famous lyricists like Béranger can, for example, be counted among "books." The most interesting case is however that of almanacs (18.4% of production in November and 15.1% in December). Very often, these indeed offer their readers songs in the midst of astrological predictions, jokes, edifying stories or practical advice. It even happens that certain almanacs are specifically song-oriented.<sup>262</sup>

The files of the stamping commission for 1855, the only year presenting us with archives sufficiently complete to be representative, constitute a second source allowing us to measure the importance of peddling song. Patrick Laharie<sup>263</sup> has counted in these archives 192 pieces in the box devoted to brochures and 363 in that grouping songs. Among the latter, several address current affairs and notably, in this year 1855, the Crimean War. These texts, which use all the tricks of chauvinism, however avoid engaging clearly in a partisan debate. Contrary to what we have observed on the stages of cafés-concerts, peddling songs that extend their remarks on French primacy into panegyrics of the regime and its leader are relatively rare.

The peddler who transports these songs in his bundles undeniably becomes an agent of propagation of a unique national type, ignoring regional particularisms. This process is certainly favored by the Parisian origin of the immense majority of collections put into circulation. Intended for the entire territory, the proposed texts are all written in French and ignore regional languages.<sup>264</sup>

Political song strictly speaking, that which marks its author's adherence to a party, is, on the other hand, absent from the files of the stamping commission of 1855. Self-censorship has, in this domain, certainly played a primordial role. The rare exceptions seem above all to testify to the ignorance that the least informed authors have of the rules to be respected. Thus J.-J.-B. Charbonnel proposes in August couplets to the glory of the "great Napoleon" and his "worthy nephew" where there is talk of the new Franco-English alliance supposed to open a new era of peace and prosperity. Nothing subversive there. Yet the censor's attentive eye does not take long to notice some verses promising the union of all nations "by the laws of fraternity," or affirming that "Holy liberty will go around the world!/Woe to anyone who would claim to stop it." This suffices for the rapporteur to request the prohibition of these couplets: "One discovers here and there returns toward socialism."<sup>265</sup> This judgment certainly surprised a songwriter whose Bonapartist sentiments seem of perfect sincerity. Other texts are thus refused the stamp on the pretext that they propose praise of workers in terms that "recall doctrines of recent date that tended to prove that workers should enter into a share of the property of the State or of capitalists"<sup>266</sup>; or, in a very different register, because, on the occasion of the Crimean War, they testify to "too ardent a proselytism in favor of Christianity."<sup>267</sup>

The refrains, quite rare, proposing servile praise of the regime, are the only ones with clearly political content. But there too the censors know how to be vigilant. The poor quality of certain verses, the negative a priori affecting songs, more easily associated with drunkards' cries than with glorifying hymns, justify a very great mistrust on the part of stamping service officials. When Denis Révillon, voltigeur in the imperial guard and panegyrist of the regime, proposes a collection<sup>268</sup> where there is only talk of "serving Napoleon," the reader of the stamping commission worries: "it is unfortunate that he believed he should dedicate this collection to the emperor and empress. The verses are of great triviality in form. They are not even verses. But the feeling is good, we have said. At a next printing I am of the opinion that the dedication be suppressed."

The files of the stamping commission for the year 1855 also confirm the close relationship established between the almanac and the diffusion of song production: at least three "singing almanacs" have solicited authorization from censorship services.<sup>269</sup> The growing importance of performers, who little by little take precedence over authors, is another piece of information provided by these archives: more and more collections propose the titles of a singer enjoying a certain renown. About thirty brochures belong to this genre which seems to have been the specialty of two bookseller-publishers: Vieillot and Durand.

The archives of the stamping commission for the year 1855 and the months of November and December 1867 thus allow us to draw a certain number of conclusions. First of all, song occupies a preponderant place in peddling literature. For 1867, even taking into account the importance of "sheets" distributed by Roger, it seems reasonable to estimate that songs represent at least 60% (1.8 million copies) of the "songs and sheets" category, that is about 30%—we find the figure noted by Alain Corbin for Haute-Vienne—of all peddling literature, which remains a considerable figure for a population of 35 million souls. Let us recall that, this same year 1867, the French press prints 963,000 copies: 763,000 for Parisian newspapers distributed among twenty-one titles, and 200,000 for the fifty-seven provincial titles.

Despite the importance of peddling song, the regime's censors do not seem to have worried much about the political danger it could represent. The main concern of the men of the stamping commission is elsewhere: to engage in the hunt for everything that can be considered risqué, "contrary to morality," to "good morals" or to religion. Béranger himself, while he is already consecrated as the "national poet," suffers their vigilance.<sup>270</sup> The reports written by members of this commission very often testify to a real disgust, expressed by people identifying with cultivated elites, for a genre considered trivial and in bad taste. Songwriters are only "workers, or declassed individuals, who, instead of attaching themselves to a serious trade, dream of popularity and, without education, give themselves out as men of letters"<sup>271</sup>; they are unworthy of speaking of respectable subjects and when they risk it, they corrupt the feelings they believe they are praising. The verses of Halbert d'Angers are thus qualified as "versified gibberish"<sup>272</sup> and, when the publisher Durand proposes a collection of songs containing a title recounting, in a light tone, the shipwreck of the frigate *La Sémillante*, the censor lets his contempt explode: "Fie! A song about that. Suppress immediately."<sup>273</sup> Very often, as Patrick Laharie has noted, the readers of the stamping commission set themselves up as veritable literary critics; they then systematically show their profound disdain for what they consider to be low-level culture. Even if it exceptionally happens that some peddlers make themselves agents of diffusion of opposition songs,<sup>274</sup> it appears clearly that social prejudices weighed more heavily on song productions of the Second Empire than strictly political repression.

The data we have for the Second Empire can be compared to the rarer information concerning previous periods.

Under the Restoration, representatives of authority often report political songs—almost exclusively Bonapartist—distributed through peddlers, among civilian populations and in the army. Sometimes the bundles contain two editions of the same brochure: the one shown to the police, with authorized songs, and the one that is distributed, with several "seditious songs."<sup>275</sup> Other works are printed abroad before being clandestinely imported into France: thus, in July 1829, a "large quantity" of Béranger's songs seized at customs is burned in the courtyard of the Valenciennes courthouse.<sup>276</sup> It is however impossible to know the exact share of songs in library trials brought before 1830, the data we have not allowing us to isolate this category.<sup>277</sup>

From this period, political songs that circulate in peddlers' bundles are not, far from it, the only cause for concern of representatives of authority. Not only are erotic songs regularly reported but also, and above all, it is the peddlers themselves who arouse the most apprehension. In June 1822, for example, the commander of the 3rd military subdivision of Nevers worries about seeing in the Morvan high concentrations of singers and itinerant merchants living from a "trade [...] of little use to society"; he consequently asks the government to "prohibit this peddling trade, or at least limit it."<sup>278</sup> Official correspondence often mentions such fears in the face of the multiplication of wanderers circumventing, by passing themselves off as peddlers, the rigors of the Napoleonic code on vagrancy; the presence in these groups of former soldiers of the Empire only increasing these anxieties.

The July Monarchy seems to have been even less alarmed by the role of peddlers in the diffusion of propaganda deemed "seditious." To understand this relative leniency, several explanations can be advanced.

A first type of reason relates to the attitude of power. Until 1834 tolerance is very great: political songs peddled in the aftermath of the July Revolution can circulate without major difficulties. These are often re-editions of songs from the French Revolution, in the form of simple leaflets<sup>279</sup> or more voluminous collections printed in a substantial number of copies.<sup>280</sup> After 1834 and the adoption of the law of February 16 on public criers, things evolve significantly in a repressive direction.

The very nature of prosecutions brought against song peddlers provides a second type of explanation for the weakness of traces they have left. Offenses of this type are indeed now treated by simple police measures, notably because the government "would no longer find a jury complaisant enough to condemn couplets."<sup>281</sup> Consequently, not only are the penalties incurred less heavy, but also, testimonies of these prosecutions are much less numerous: justice files, reports from police prefects, those written by gendarmerie commanders or king's prosecutors, rarely take the trouble to mention simple contraventions.

Moreover, under the July Monarchy, militant networks, notably republican ones, are much more effective than during the Restoration and, even after the laws of February 1834 and September 1835, they have their own means of diffusion. Among the numerous publications offered are collections of political songs: the most famous, published by Pagnerre in 1834, being *Les Républicaines, chansons populaires des révolutions de 1789, 1792 et 1830*. Republican societies, too, publish and distribute collections of revolutionary songs.<sup>282</sup> All works that are not distributed by peddlers.

At the same time, newspapers tend to grant an increasingly important place to song. All types of refrains find their place there. There even appear periodicals entirely devoted to them, like *L'Écho lyrique*, *La Voix du peuple* by Gustave Leroy in 1844<sup>283</sup> or, two years later, *La Lyre du peuple* by Auguste Alais<sup>284</sup>; these last two publications being of a very pronounced republican tendency. A certain opinion press—like *Le Populaire*, *Le Charivari*, or *La Démocratie pacifique*—also devotes a non-negligible part of its columns to couplets treating, generally with irony, political problems. In December 1839, the Saint-Simonian songwriter Vinçard launches *La Ruche populaire*, a monthly written "by and for workers." In each issue several pieces in verse are published, some being intended to be sung. Almanacs, in which songs traditionally occupy an important place, can also be published by a "party"; like the *Almanach social*, Fourierist, of 1841 or *Almanach icarien*, of 1843 which appears until 1852 and contains an "Icarian Songbook."<sup>285</sup>

As we have seen, the year 1848 is that of the profusion of political propaganda put into circulation by peddlers. Innumerable newspapers, brochures and almanacs are printed and distributed. In this mass, political song, essentially democrat-socialist or Bonapartist, occupies a primordial place. The pillars of the Parisian goguette—but also Pierre Dupont who always remained outside this group—take advantage of this situation to widely circulate their productions which most often espouse the state of mind of the moment. Print runs are often between 1,000 and 3,000 copies, even if some are clearly more substantial: twice 10,000 for *Le Chœur des montagnards*, 8,000 for *La Marseillaise des travailleurs*, 26,000 for *La Républicaine* by Auguste Joly, 6,000 for *Louis-Philippe et son ami Guizot* by Alexis Dalès, several copies of *La Marseillaise* and *Le Chant du départ* including one at 27,000 copies<sup>286</sup>, etc. In the continuity of the work published by Pagnerre in 1834, Louis-Charles Durand proposes a collection with very "Montagnard" tones, entitled *La Voix du peuple ou les républicaines de 1848*, printed at 12,000 copies<sup>287</sup>, intended for peddling and which meets with undeniable success.<sup>288</sup> This same Louis-Charles Durand launches, in July 1848, *Le Républicain lyrique, journal des chanteurs, politique, comique et satirique* which proposes songs written to the glory of the social republic by the group of goguettiers: thirteen issues of this monthly published until July 1849 and printed at 10,000 copies<sup>289</sup>, see the light of day.

From 1849 the work of peddlers is more strictly regulated within the framework of the control policy engaged in the aftermath of the presidential and legislative elections, without however managing to prevent the circulation of democratic songs: the prosecutor of the Amiens district still worries, in April 1850, about the distribution, by agents of "socialist propaganda," of *La Voix du peuple ou les républicaines de 1848* and, in May 1851, of the "evil" done by Pierre Dupont's collections.<sup>290</sup>

The peddlers of the Second Republic however do not transport in their bundles only songs favorable to the ideas of democrat-socialists. Bonapartist song propaganda also experiences considerable growth, notably thanks to the publications of Léon Guillemin (L. de Chaumont).

Alongside this multitude of small cheap publications, some rare collections present themselves in the form of quality works, more voluminous, elegantly bound, often illustrated with carefully done engravings and intended for a more fortunate audience. These are works by famous authors benefiting both from authentic popular success and recognition in cultivated circles: Pierre Dupont, from 1851 with a preface by Charles Baudelaire, and above all, from 1816, Béranger. In this form, song no longer claims its proximity to "the street"; it seeks first to assert itself as a literary genre in its own right.

##### The Publishers

Under the Restoration, only a few recognized songwriters whose names guarantee substantial sales, essentially Béranger and Debraux, have the privilege of seeing their works taken on by publishers. These two personalities then dominate song publishing to the point that many authors who hope to make a name for themselves ask Béranger to preface their collection and that, according to Bachimont, the publisher Roy-Terry offered five francs to lyricists to write titles that Émile Debraux would sign, "the only one who sold."<sup>291</sup>

After 1830, things evolve significantly. Once more it seems that the networks of goguettiers have been the motor of these changes. Publishers, themselves songwriters, then make themselves champions of the diffusion of productions from Parisian goguettes.

In this group, Louis-Charles Durand is the personality who seems to have played the most important role. Born in Jouy-en-Josas on February 10, 1804, he is put into apprenticeship from childhood without having been schooled and becomes a wallpaper worker then bronze founder. Regular spectator at Parisian theaters, he creates a troupe of comedians, all artisans, who give performances in the greater Parisian suburbs. In the aftermath of the Three Glorious Days he becomes a street singer and joins the Lice chansonnière. From this period he devotes all his efforts, and all his money, without anyone knowing how he was able to constitute his initial funds, to publishing street and goguette singers in small notebooks sent by bundles throughout France.<sup>292</sup> In the aftermath of the Revolution of 1848, he offers very numerous compositions written in the spirit of the extreme republican left, like the collections *La Voix du peuple*: one from 1848, the other from 1849.<sup>293</sup> The monthly *Le Républicain lyrique* is also distributed in the "song bookstore" he opened at 32 rue Rambuteau. *La Lanterne magique républicaine* is another periodical available at this address, which offers songs and political articles written by goguettiers. Throughout the Second Republic, Durand multiplies leaflets of socializing songs, which could lead one to believe he is the accredited publisher of Montagnard songwriters. In fact, this is not the case. Not only does the latter not belong to this current but he affirms his Bonapartist convictions very early. A songwriter himself, he proposes as early as 1849 *L'Ombre de Napoléon, ou le Serment à la Constitution*, a song praising the new president placed under the double protection of his uncle and the French Republic of which he would be the best defender. The coup d'état of 1851 in no way shakes his convictions; under the Empire he writes several titles favorable to the regime. The Durand house can therefore in no way be considered as directly linked to the extreme republican left: it is not the bookstore of the Montagnards but that of the goguettiers, including those whose republican or socialist opinions are clearly established, like Charles Gille, Louis Festeau, Auguste Alais or Gustave Leroy. It thus testifies to the existence of a veritable group of authors linked by bonds of friendship and solidarity that transcend their political convictions. In 1863, Durand's funeral, where the socialist Louis Festeau pronounces the funeral eulogy<sup>294</sup>, mobilizes numerous songwriters and street singers of the capital and, there again, parties fade behind the affinities that unite this group. Not only does Louis-Charles Durand fill peddlers' bundles with couplets intended to circulate throughout the territory but he also facilitates the introduction of goguettiers to café-concert directors.<sup>295</sup> This bookseller plays such a role in the publication of songs intended for peddling that he attempts, in 1855, to negotiate a compromise to his advantage with the stamping commission. He proposes that a catalog approved by the administration replace the stamp affixed to each copy: peddlers or singers would only have to present this document to exercise their activity. This suggestion is very dryly rejected by imperial officials who fear thus facilitating the task of potential offenders and refuse to endorse a measure that "would resemble an exclusive privilege for the Durand and Co. house."<sup>296</sup>

Obviously, after December 2, political song, with the sole exception of patriotic couplets, is absent from works peddled through the care of the owner of the Song Bookstore. In the collections he distributes, republican authors prudently abstain from affirming their convictions and content themselves with presenting titles belonging to one of the genres popularized by the goguette.

It is interesting to note that Louis-Charles Durand was able to direct the Song Bookstore and distribute all these printed matter without possessing the license imposed on booksellers and printers: no file concerning him having been preserved in the files of the National Archives. Perhaps a thorough study of the one hundred and eleven boxes devoted to printers and booksellers of the Seine department licensed between 1815 and 1870 would allow finding a diploma granted to another name for the Song Bookstore on rue Rambuteau. The most probable is, however, that he benefited from the tolerance granted to the most modest booksellers, notably those who publish works of small and medium peddling. When Le Bailly, a publisher rather specialized in risqué song, asks in April 1837 to obtain a license, we learn that he has already been exercising "for more than fifteen years," without authorization, this profession.<sup>297</sup> The republican bookseller Pagnerre, secretary general of the provisional government of 1848, is only licensed in November 1850 while "his printing establishment has twenty years of existence."<sup>298</sup> Roger probably does not possess a bookstore license either<sup>299</sup>: specialized in religious works, he also distributes several song collections. Louis-Charles Durand, like most publishers of songs intended for peddling, must therefore have been one of those unlicensed printers then called "canardiers."

Just like Louis-Charles Durand, Henri Piaud (1807-1865) is both a goguette songwriter—he frequents a Belleville society—and a bookseller, unlicensed, installed on rue Beauregard who publishes essentially song collections. His generosity toward authors in need has earned him the nickname "Saint Vincent de Paul of songwriters."<sup>300</sup> In 1848, he writes several titles marking his engagement alongside militants of the republican left. After 1850, when the goguettes have everything to fear from police persecutions, he gathers in his back room "celebrities" of these societies who discuss there and above all sing there sheltered from the eyes of police sergeants. His catalog also included several titles from the classical repertoire.

A certain number of other establishments specialized in song deserve to be cited. First of all Perrotin, Béranger's publisher who, he too, does not seem to have possessed a license. But also Le Bailly whose house, according to an August 1862 report, "has long been known for publishing works of doubtful morality." This bookseller presented as a specialist in "obscene" works—he is condemned in December 1868 for having published *La Malice des grandes filles*<sup>301</sup>—also distributes café-concert songs, including titles by Alexis Bouvier<sup>302</sup> or Jean-Baptiste Clément<sup>303</sup> and some collections where indeed the light and risqué genre dominates. Eyssautier—he too is not licensed—is, with Durand and Piaud, an important publisher of works by Parisian goguettiers under the July Monarchy and the Second Republic. He notably distributes creations presented at the society of Templiers<sup>304</sup>, in which Flora Tristan participated for a time, as well as the *Chant d'ouverture*, signed by Alexandre Guérin, of the Enfants du vaudeville. Gustave Leroy and Charles Gille are also welcomed at Eyssautier's who offers several song collections intended to be sold in the streets or by peddlers. Aubert is another "great" of peddling song. He begins as early as 1834 the publication of an annual collection entitled *Chansonnier nouveau*, printed without interruption until 1868. We also owe him an *Écho des goguettes* that appears regularly from 1851 to 1857 and numerous booklets typical of peddling songs among which Bonapartist refrains are relatively frequent. This tendency does not prevent his widow, who took over the business at her husband's death, from publishing *Chants républicains* in 1871. Terry, the one who paid songwriters to write couplets that he then had signed by Debraux, presents a catalog in which we find some titles of republican inspiration like *La Chambre et les écoles* by Agénor Altaroche in December 1830, *L'Arc-en-ciel de la Liberté ou Couronne lyrique offerte à ses défenseurs* (1831), the *Chansons nationales* by Victor Basière (1849), etc. To conclude this list of main song publishers, it is appropriate to mention the case of Victor Ludovic Vieillot. This son of an Argenton hairdresser born October 5, 1820, has been a publisher for "about 6 years"—"his special genre is song"—when he obtains in June 1846 his bookstore permit.<sup>305</sup> The collections of the Lice chansonnière, the *Chansons de Momus* or the couplets of Louis Festeau already belong to his catalog and he has made agreements with "all the music merchants of Paris to sell songs and romances from their stocks at a good price." The police seem to have first worried about this man whose political opinions are "a bit advanced since he publishes democratic brochures and popular songs," but the relations he establishes with the commissioner of his neighborhood quickly dissipate their apprehensions. Just like Durand or Piaud, he actively participates in singing societies.<sup>306</sup> During the Second Republic he publishes numerous socializing titles and, under the Second Empire, multiplies song collections intended for peddling and continues to ensure the diffusion of works by the main goguettiers, including those whose democratic opinions are known. According to Eugène Baillet he would even have been the only one to ensure acceptable income for Charles Gille, while Durand and Eyssautier were content to pay him for his compositions at a rate of 50 centimes per couplet.<sup>307</sup> Vieillot's popularity in the small world of song authors is incontestable: Alexis Dales dedicates to him in 1857 his *Biographie poétique de Béranger* and Charles Colmance dedicates a song to him in the collection he publishes in 1862. The publisher is presented there as the defender of authors victim of plagiarists and the distributor of all types of songs, including those that make themselves apostles of "progress" and "propaganda."
