## Summary
This July 28, 1852 circular from Minister of Police de Maupas, published in Le Moniteur Universel on August 6, introduces the stamp system for colportage materialsâ€”the foundational policy referenced in the September 1852 follow-up circular. The document presents colportage as a dangerous industry requiring urgent control, describing peddlers as a "veritable army" spreading "anarchist propaganda" across France. De Maupas frames the stamp requirement as protecting populations from "harmful writings" while facilitating distribution of approved materials. The circular establishes that all colportage items must bear an official stamp (applied to cover or first page) before sale, with violation enabling immediate police seizure. Two stamp types are introduced: those applied by prefectures (implicitly the red stamps) and a special stamp for mayors. The circular emphasizes surveillance capabilities, noting that stamps will allow authorities to verify authenticity and prevent counterfeits. This represents a significant expansion of state control over popular print distribution, transforming colportage from a relatively free trade into a highly regulated system requiring pre-approval of all materials.
