**CIRCULAR.**

Paris, July 28, 1852.

Mr. Prefect,

Among the measures that must awaken the solicitude of government agents, the surveillance and suppression of clandestine publications appear in the first rank. These publications are weapons that the Government's adversaries use to combat it. The force upon which it relies can be effective only through the reason on which it rests; but it seems that creatures can declare at any moment open war against the society to which they owe their protection. It is important to guarantee public opinion against everything that could vitiate or lead it into false directions. Nothing is more harmful to the spirits of goodness, who conscientiously seek to enlighten themselves on political questions, than the lying works, the perfidious calumnies that the bad attempt too often to propagate.

To weaken its authority, to discredit it in public usage, all means appear good to them. Spreading brochures, pamphlets, defamatory libels; they spare no expense, provided that the foreign presses defy the prohibition that strikes them. Propaganda takes a thousand forms: it knows how to slip its writings under the name of merchants and even under various kinds of packages. Books are presented under a deceptive title and known, and when one examines them, one is left with indignation after a few pages filled with reprehensible doctrines that one believed to be disseminating and spreading. It is not in vain that the law punishes attempts, neither the simple citizen, nor even the public man; and it is principally when it comes to attacking the feelings of devotion and respect for its agents that authority must call for the attention of the maneuvers and sovereign war that serious gravity calls for protective action. Especially, you must oppose an energetic and incessant obstacle to their maneuvers. I count on your zeal to deploy, in any case, vigilance against similar ruses. Active surveillance must be exercised in all frontier departments, so that prohibited publications do not infiltrate, by any means.

But the most powerful auxiliary of these occult distributions is, without question, the industry of colportage. It is dangerous, though authorized and regulated by law; it seems to protect itself under the aegis of legality, at the same time as it slips everywhere the venom of anarchist propaganda under the presumed protection of authority itself. The agents it employs constitute a veritable army that spreads across the entire surface of the territory. Its leaders are in Paris, it has its discipline, its rules, its method of enlisting, varying according to localities and circumstances, but everywhere and always the same: to attack governments, to uproot healthy and religious ideas, to corrupt morals, to sow calumny, and to develop as well those guilty passions that only speculate on popular credulity.

Without doubt, to oppose the harmful propaganda of colportage, the Government finds useful assistance in the cities of some importance, and even more effective still is the loyal institution of rural commissioners; but it cannot be seconded as completely by the functionaries of rural communes. It is sometimes very difficult, even difficult, to compare the titles of a large number of books that a peddler presents or tolerates with the statements in the approved catalog seen by you. Thus a certain quantity of prohibited books circulate with impunity precisely where they are most harmful, I mean to say in the villages.

It was necessary to obviate this inconvenience by making control more rapid, easier, and, consequently, more certain and surer.

Consequently, I have decided that each copy of a work that anyone — written or engraved, contained in the ball of the volume and before you have authorized its sale, must henceforth bear a special stamp at each prefecture, and affixed in your offices. Anyone not bearing this stamp will be immediately seized. The judicial police officers of all ranks will be able, henceforth, through a rapid examination, to ensure that the books, whatever their number, found in the possession of the peddler, have received the prefect's approval, and also this comparative reading of the titles of works with those shown in the catalog, which caused embarrassments and slowness, will become an almost always unnecessary precaution.

You will soon receive the special stamp intended for your department. To avoid any counterfeiting, the imprint must be affixed to all parcels and all town halls.

Through careful comparison, it will be easy to convince oneself of the authenticity or falseness of the stamp with which the stamped works will be covered.

It is understood, Mr. Prefect, that the affixing of the special stamp in no way undermines the legal character required by the authorization required by art. 6 of the law of 27 July 1849; it is, on the contrary, only the confirmation and complement. The distribution permit will always be issued in the past: the stamp will be an additional means of surveillance and prevention.

Art. 6 of the law of 27 July gave rise to numerous instructions from the ministers of the interior, to whom, before the creation of the ministry of general police, belonged the policing of the press; I can only refer to them; but, among the measures that these instructions recommended, there is one to which I attach particular importance: it is the sending of information collected about peddlers, information prescribed by the circular of 6 September 1849. The centralization at my ministry of all this information will ensure greater efficiency and unity of surveillance. To give it an extended and regular character, you will kindly send me henceforth a monthly statement of the authorizations granted by you to peddlers. This statement will particularly contain their names, birthplaces, the titles of the works they were carrying, and what you will have learned about those works admitted to circulate. I will thus embrace the entire operation of colportage, the more or less suspect character of the agents it employs, its harmless or dangerous developments.

Among the numerous duties that your high functions impose on you, there are few, Mr. Prefect, that more imperiously demand your activity and vigilance. By protecting populations against the pernicious influences whose effects I point out to you, you will make your administration easier and you will have worthily cooperated in the goal that the head of State has so nobly indicated: the triumph of truth.

Receive, Mr. Prefect, the assurance of my very distinguished consideration.

*The Minister of General Police*,  
DE MAUPAS.
