## Summary
This 1852 circular from Minister of Police de Maupas establishes new regulations for colportage (peddling) in France, requiring all peddlers to obtain departmental authorization and introducing a stamping system for approved materials. The document consists of a cover letter to Hautes-Pyrénées peddlers explaining the new requirements, followed by the full ministerial circular detailing implementation procedures. Key elements include mandatory authorization from prefects (with 15-day processing time), centralized oversight through the ministry to prevent circumvention across departments, and a dual stamping system (red stamps valid departmentally, blue stamps valid nationally). The circular emphasizes the government's goal to "moralize" colportage by preventing distribution of "harmful writings that mislead the mind and corrupt the heart," while facilitating distribution of "useful books." This represents a significant tightening of state control over popular print distribution during the early Second Empire.
