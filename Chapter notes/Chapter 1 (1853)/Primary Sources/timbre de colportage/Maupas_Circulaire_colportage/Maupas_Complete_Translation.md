Paris, September 23, 1852.

**TO THE GENTLEMEN PEDDLERS OF HAUTES-PYRÉNÉES.**

I am sending you the circular from the minister of police regarding the authorization required of each peddler, so that you know exactly what you must do to comply with it and be able to practice your trade without difficulty.

You will need to obtain without delay the required documents, and you will send them with your authorization request to the prefect of the department where you wish to begin working. At the same time, you will ask the prefect to send you said authorization, either to your residence or poste restante in such and such a city; or, if you prefer, you will tell him to hold it at your disposal in his offices where you will go to claim it yourself.

Each of your servants must also obtain a personal authorization, and if you attach their request to the one you address for yourself to the prefect, you will include, for each servant, the same supporting documents as yours (1).

From the date of arrival of your request at a prefecture, it will take approximately fifteen days for you to obtain authorization.

I await your news before sending you anything.

I have the honor of greeting you.

**CIRCULAR FROM THE MINISTER OF POLICE ON PEDDLING.**

Mr. Prefect, I am asked whether the stamp placed on books offered for sale by means of peddling exempts peddlers from the authorization that article 11 of the law of July 27, 1849 obliges them to request from the prefect of the department they wish to travel through.

There can be no doubt in this regard.

The new measures I have deemed necessary to prescribe, far from undermining the legislative provisions, must, on the contrary, ensure their effectiveness.

In accordance with the law of July 27, 1849, you will therefore continue to issue for your department the authorizations that peddlers must carry; but, to facilitate these tradesmen in the exercise of their profession, I have decided that they may send you their authorization request in advance and in writing, without being required to present themselves at your prefecture, on the condition that they include with their other supporting documents (1) an indication of their place of residence, where your decision will be notified to them.

You may issue authorization to peddlers domiciled in your department without waiting for information from my ministry, while taking care to inform me. Nevertheless, you will not follow up on the request of peddlers who are not domiciled there before having transmitted their requests to me and before having received my instructions.

Through the centralization at my ministry of individual files, surveillance of peddling personnel will be exercised with more coherence and unity, and those who have committed an infraction in one department will not be able to deceive the prefect in another.

You will very soon receive the stamp necessary for affixing the stamp prescribed in my circular of July 28 last. This stamp must be placed on the first page containing the title and the name of the publisher of each volume intended to be sold by means of peddling.

Any individual intending to submit a work for stamping must first present to your prefecture a copy of this work, which you will immediately transmit to my ministry, so that it may be read by the commission charged with examining peddled books. I will then decide whether it is appropriate to grant the stamp.

A catalog of books authorized by the examination commission will be sent to you each month, and more often if necessity requires. If the books submitted to you are listed in this catalog, you may authorize stamping without referring to me.

The red stamp, affixed at your prefecture at the request of the author, publisher, bookseller or peddler, will only be valid for the department entrusted to your administration.

The blue stamp, affixed by the direction of printing, bookshops and the press, will allow the circulation of the stamped volume throughout France.

I am convinced, Mr. Prefect, that your active cooperation will not fail the administration in the execution of these measures; the government, moreover, does not leave you disarmed before infractions that might occur.

Article 7 of the law of July 27, 1849 establishes, indeed, a penalty for peddlers not provided with authorization, and it will always be possible for you to withdraw this authorization from offenders who sell non-stamped books.

You will understand, I have no doubt, Mr. Prefect, that the instructions that are the subject of my circular have no other goal than to moralize the practice of peddling, to repress its abuses and to protect populations from the propaganda of those harmful writings that mislead the mind and corrupt the heart.

I urge you, consequently, to conform to the thinking that has dictated this circular and the one I had the honor of addressing to you on July 28 last, to exercise active surveillance regarding peddlers, and, at the same time, to give authorization and stamping requests as prompt a response as possible, so as not to bring any hindrance to the peddling of useful books.

Receive, Mr. Prefect, the assurance of my very distinguished consideration.

*The Minister of General Police*, DE MAUPAS.
