Chapter 6
Operatic Competition
The Café- Concert
Among theater managers, competition was the word on everyone’s lips through-
out the century from the 1830s to the 1930s— even more than decentralization and
infinitely more than regionalism. The “divide and rule” effects of Napoleonic leg-
islation proved impossible to shake off, making each municipality (or arrondisse-
ment) the site of separate internal competitions regulated by law and overseen
by the town hall and by the Préfecture. Where opera was concerned, from the
1850s onward, these internal competitions related overwhelmingly to the rise of
unsubsidized genres of popular entertainment: café- concerts, operetta, and, later,
cinema. By the 1930s, amateur and spectator sports provided yet another threat.
Neither were the positions of these genres stable: café- concerts were overtaken
by music halls and music halls by cinemas. At some time or other everyone cried
foul, requested protection or subsidy or the censoring of others, and argued for the
“educative” value of their artistic offering.
The role of the state here was fundamentally different from its role in respect
to opera and spoken theater: until 1864, these counted as arts to be managed,
whereas entertainment was a matter of public morals to be policed. Battles
between theater managers and the owners of café- concerts were frequent,
quickly became a matter for the Préfet or even the Minister and were usu-
ally resolved in favor of the theater manager, especially once it became clear
how quickly cafés- concerts were multiplying in urban and industrial centers,
and how effective they were at draining audiences from subsidized forms of
stage entertainment. Hence an 1850 complaint from theater manager Ricard
(Lille) about not being able to tax summer competition from certain kinds of
concerts immediately drew from the Ministre de l’Intérieur a reply about the
scourge of café- concerts and the need, “if the Manager’s complaint is justi-
fied, to remind the Municipality that it must defend itself against an invasion
that could end up closing down Lille’s theater” [dans le cas où la réclamation
du Directeur serait fondée, de rappeler à l’autorité Municipale qu’elle doit le

défendre contre un envahissement qui aboutirait à la fermeture du théâtre de
Lille].1 It was left to both the mayor and the Préfet to point out that Lille—
indeed the entire département— as yet had no café- concerts (the first applica-
tion came in 1853) and that the problem lay rather with a succession of one- off
charitable events.2 The hair- trigger response from Paris, though misguided, was
prescient. In 1852, it was already a concern for central government that café-
concerts in Limoges, another industrial center, were illegally doing numbers
from new operas.3
For those in the theater industry, café- concerts caused consternation for
the simple reason that their owners and promoters developed a parallel stage-
music industry that tapped deeply into audience preferences at a time when
operatic renewal was at a low ebb. Based around the chanson, it extended
quickly from cafés with rowdy spectator singing around a piano (“beuglants”
or “assauts de chant”) to more gentrified venues with clear separation between
performers and audience and repertoire from opéra- comique and operettas,
including dance numbers. Café- concerts developed in different ways across
the country, with Marseille, Toulouse, Lyon, and Bordeaux becoming major
centers with differentiated offerings catering to different sectors of the public.
By the 1870s, alongside unregulated “beuglants” in the working- class Croix-
Rousse area,4 and small café- concerts using a piano- led ensemble, Lyon had
three café- concerts the size of its main theaters (i.e., seating between 1,500 and
2,000) and using an orchestra of more than twenty players; most did operetta,
and publics ranged from the decorous to the lively.5 During the same period,
Lille, Roubaix, and their environs were less opulently served if the numerous
applications— invariably turned down— for the addition of pianos to cafés and
estaminets are anything to go by. Here, the mayor and Préfet viewed the café-
concert market as saturated, but the “beuglant” was still a force to be tamed.6 The
same holds for the western Brittany town of Quimper, where the first applica-
tion for a café- concert, the Grand Café de la Liberté, was filed as late as 1884,
and whose authorization was dependent on clauses that had been instituted
in Lyon for the previous twenty years: that no amateur would be permitted to

sing (the “assaut de chant” problem), and that singers would not mix with the
audience (the prostitution problem).7
In Marseille and Bordeaux, the recurring challenge was to neutralize the
determination of café- concert owners to compete directly with theaters. At
Marseille, an early precedent for café- concert owners had already appeared
in April 1858, in that summer operetta at the Château- des- Fleurs was autho-
rized by the ministry with the support of the then manager of the Théâtre
Beauvau, L.- Danican Philidor— that support presumably granted because the
license applied out of season only.8 The ministry received a similar request the
following month, from the Alcazar, and refused it.9 Strange to say, the follow-
ing year the Minister of State deplored the extent to which the seven café-
concerts in Marseille were flouting their licenses and putting on staged musical
excerpts.10 Costumes and sets, ostensibly forbidden under pre- 1864 licensing
arrangements, quickly became standard, but café- concerts retained a crucial
informality as entertainment venues— via their embrace of drinking, smoking,
and in- performance chatter.
By the 1860s, the industry had its own performer agencies, press outlets,
hierarchies of venue (and of publics), intertown rivalries, and even a débuts
system of sorts.11 Beyond a censorship régime that became unenforceable as
the industry expanded, café- concerts suffered none of the official expectations
that theaters had to contend with. The cahier des charges was a list of restrictions
rather than demands, there was no artistic oversight from the town hall, and no
expectation, even, that performances would be in French. It is no surprise, then,
to find regional variety that allies with other sensitivities to place and local tra-
dition. Tensions between Parisian and local points of reference are embedded in
the name and repertoire of the Caveau de Montmartre in Brest, where Breton-
themed chansons appeared in 1907 alongside the cabaret chansons of Aristide
Bruant; at around the same time this naval port also sported a Café Parisien and
a Bar et Café de la Tour Eiffel.12 Breton- themed did not, however, mean use of
the Breton language.
In the commercial port of Marseille, the picture was more cosmopolitan
and sometimes unusually localist. Marseille had numerous café- concerts by the

1850s, but at the Casino and the Alcazar, chansons in Occitan were common,
rooted in the urban popular literature of worker poets and transformed in
particular by the chansonnier Victor Gelu, who turned to Occitan in the 1850s
after a successful career writing in French.13 The resolutely nonfolkloric nature
of Occitan café- concert culture meant that it operated a world away from
the Provençal literary renaissance spearheaded by the Félibrige under Joseph
Roumanille and Frédéric Mistral. As a project dedicated to valorizing a set
of spoken dialects by consolidating them into an agreed (and invented) liter-
ary language, the Félibrige could hardly fail to appear elitist and inauthentic to
working- class performers using a daily language they had never renounced and
which needed no reinvention, still less embourgeoisement.
14 To test the extent
of the tension between two forms of cultural localism divided by a single
language, we need only do the thought experiment of imagining Mistral—
patrician author of ruralist epic poetry, inventor of decorous rites of passage for
upstanding young women, and founder of a museum of traditional Provençal
culture— settling in with a round of drinks at the Alcazar.
At these two venues of Casino and Alcazar— both in the center of Marseille
and a few minutes’ walk from the Théâtre Beauvau— Occitan chansons jostled
not only with French but also with Italian, Greek, and Castilian up to World War
I, reflecting Marseille’s identity as an international crossroads for trade.15 With
their stonemasons, rug- makers, and locksmiths as singers, were café- concerts,
then, truly a threat to opera? Undoubtedly yes, in that working- class audiences
went to opera in French as well as running their daily lives in Occitan— and
their musicians occasionally ended up singing on the operatic stage.16 Where
audiences, musicians, and dancers were concerned, the parallel universe of café-
concert did not preclude porosity: that was precisely one of the threats for
municipal theater managers. In Marseille, the ease of movement was exposed
the moment the 1864 legislation disrupted Marseille’s operatic life, and when,
during an interregnum, the Théâtre Beauvau’s dancers and chorus singers were
to be found on the city’s café- concert stages.17 Bordeaux provides an even more
striking case in the person of Edmond Dédé, a free African American from

Marseille music- hall singers became famous enough to tour, that the linguistic compromise
of the interlanguage “Francitan” became necessary, leading eventually to the French- language
exoticizing of Marseille culture (akin to the portrayal of Brittany by Théodore Botrel) in
the 1930s operettas of Vincent Scotto, the films of Marcel Pagnol, and the Marseille- themed
chansons of Alibert. Barsotti, Music- hall marseillais, 131– 137.

New Orleans and Paris- trained composer, violinist, and conductor, who wrote
two ballets mounted at the Grand- Théâtre (Nénéha, 1863, and La Sensitive,
1877) while remaining professionally active in both the opera and café- concert
sectors. Around 1865— coinciding with the liberté des théâtres—
Dédé moved
from being the Grand- Théâtre’s ballet répétiteur to conducting the orchestra
at the Alcazar café- concert and writing chansons, managing the Café- Delta
(1870), moving to Algiers as solo violinist at the Grand- Théâtre, working at
the Marseille Casino, and returning to Bordeaux (the Alcazar and the Folies-
Bordelaises, around 1880).18
In the major French towns, the café- concert became a vibrant and near-
uncontrollable phenomenon that lasted well into the twentieth century and
whose heyday coincided with the uncertainties of the post- 1864 era. For this
latter reason it instilled fear. Even before 1864 we see battle joined and licensed
theater managers leveraging the protections offered by theatrical centralization,
invoking all levels of the state machinery to neutralize café- concert opposition.
In Bordeaux, the café- concert situation in 1860 was that they were banned in
the town center but tolerated in the suburbs, where there were already five, of
which two were new arrivals. According to the town’s Commissaire Central, in
the suburbs of Caudéran and La Bastide they exerted a “disastrous” [désastreux]
competitive pressure on existing venues and in at least one case peddled obscen-
ity. He wished he could recommend shutting down the two café- concerts the
Préfet had just authorized at La Bastide (a workers’ quarter on the other side
of the Gironde from central Bordeaux), but he recognized that the owners had
already invested too much to be stopped. All he could do was to advise against
any new authorizations in the entire Bordeaux area, on the basis that “these
establishments are at once contrary to the interests of the town’s poor, its the-
aters, and the state of public morals” [ces établissements sont à la fois contraires
aux intérêts des pauvres de la ville, des théâtres, et l’état de la morale pub-
lique].19 One of those new owners was Martial Léglise, dit Bazas, who became a
thorn in the side of Achille Biche- Latour, the manager at the Grand- Théâtre in
Bordeaux. Despite Biche- Latour’s objections to the project from its inception
in 1859,20 Léglise built and from 1861 operated the Alcazar café- concert at La
Bastide— the café- concert at which Edmond Dédé would become conduc-
tor. According to Biche- Latour, by May 1862 Léglise was already flouting the

law having set up a staged entertainment where the law allowed him stand- up
chansons only and having stolen several of the Grand- Théâtre’s dancers and
musicians in the process:
whether in mounting ballets or plays with several characters, whether in permitting
cross- dressing or costumes on the Alcazar stage. I said stage, and it is pertinent for us to
remember, Mr Prefect, that the Alcazar is in effect organized as a theater with various
changes of scenery and not as a café- concert.
21
Biche- Latour won this battle— one that was played out countless times across
France— but he did not win the war. With support from local officials at Cenon-
la- Bastide, Léglise objected to the prefectoral decrees that emerged from Biche-
Latour’s protest, and not least to the licensed manager being allowed to open
a summer theater called the Bouffes de Plaisance. He appealed directly to the
Emperor for permission to put on “ballets, pantomimes et scènettes” at a venue
to be called the Alcazar du Prince Impérial, and when that and further appeals
failed, he applied in 1863 to open a “théâtre de genre”— which was reluc-
tantly granted.22 It must have been as galling for Biche- Latour to read Léglise’s
reponse to the impending liberté as it was important to Léglise to write it: a self-
justificatory pamphlet entitled Des Théâtres de Bordeaux,
23 in which he argued
that his establishment was bringing significant public benefit and was not a rival
to the Grand- Théâtre:
I can accordingly confirm that my establishment needs to exist for several reasons,
firstly as a popular spectacle, helping to moralize the masses, encouraging the taste
for singing and for music, [secondly] because it would contribute more to creating
theater- lovers than taking them away, and finally because to ban this genre of spectacle
and to deprive the working and manual- laborer classes of it, would possibly return
them to old tastes, causing them to adopt for their leisure the venues they abandoned
when the Alcazar was created.24

The terms of the ministerial assent, dated 8 August 1863, allowed Léglise to do
“exclusively” operetta, pantomime, dance, and military scenas— yet on 13 May
1864, alongside a mimed drama with effects of fire and flame, we find him
advertising arias from Le Trouvère and Le Barbier de Séville, an arrangement from
Balfe’s Bohémienne, and the overture from Auber’s Le Domino noir. The bottom
section of the poster gives advance publicity of a benefit evening for the fol-
lowing day, complete with an aria from Guillaume Tell to be sung by the “fort
ténor” Audouin and advertised as “repeated by public demand” [redemandé].25
Less than two months before the official “liberté” of 1 July 1864, it seems Léglise
scented freedom.
He also influenced events elsewhere in that by late September 1863, Jules
Surian, director of the Marseille Alcazar, was artfully misquoting the terms of
Léglise’s contract to the Minister of Fine Arts and petitioning to do the same
genres, “encouraged,” as he wrote, “by what has just happened in Bordeaux
in relation to the Alcazar café- concert, whose manager has been authorized
to mount and perform opera extracts, pantomimes, ballets, opéra- bouffe etc, in
return for a security deposit paid to the Bordeaux Town Council and not to
the Theaters Manager.”26 The playing off of arts legislation against that of public
order was made possible by the fact that theaters constituted an office within
the Ministry of State; but it was typical of the creative slippage between art and
entertainment that café- concert managers deployed so successfully.
One answer for municipal theater managers was to try to corner the opposi-
tion market and to gain ministerial assent to run a theater that did operetta and/
or café- concert repertory alongside the principal municipal stage. In Marseille,
in 1864, there were rumors, strenuously denied, of precisely such a situation
with a Bouffes- Marseillaises, to be run by Halanzier alongside the Théâtre
Beauvau.27 Léglise’s consternation, when Biche- Latour secured permission in
1862 to manage a summer Bouffes de Plaisance in Bordeaux, suggests the prob-
able reaction of café- concert owners to the Halanzier rumours in Marseille,
two years later.28 Finally, intergenerational evidence of porosity in Bordeaux
comes from the Bory family, where father and son (Jean and Fernand) man-
aged the singing, circus acts, and pantomimes of the Folies- Bordelaises succes-
sively from its opening in 1872 to its closure in 1893, by which time the venue
had hosted all the Parisian stars from Thérésa and Paulus to the young Yvette

Guilbert.29 The following decade saw Fernand Bory managing five successive
opera seasons at Bordeaux’s Grand- Théâtre between 1907 and 1913, during
which time he introduced Bordeaux audiences to Siegfried, Madama Butterfly,
Manon Lescaut, Girl of Golden West, Messager’s Fortunio, and an important “local”
work, Raoul Laparra’s La Habanera.
Operetta
It was not the chanson alone that constituted the café- concert’s direct com-
petition to the traditions of the opera house; it was the chanson in conjunc-
tion with operetta or opéra- bouffe—
that younger cousin of opéra- comique and, in
Offenbach’s hands, a genre for parodying Grand Opera. As Marie- Claire Mussat
notes, the attractions of operetta for provincial theater managers in secondary
towns (she is talking specifically about Rennes) were multiple: it connoted
Parisian modernity, it was not too demanding of singers and orchestra but
remained unquestionably operatic, and it was cost- effective.30 To that I would
add that it was by far the fastest- renewing genre in all of opera, and although it
took no time at all for favorites to take hold, the novelty rate was always high.
Critics railed; audiences turned out.
The tirades of the Wagnerian critic Étienne Destranges about early 1890s
Nantes are extreme but illuminating in their diagnosis of the tensions between
the curation, on principal regional stages, of art forms that were commercially
viable in relation to those that were not. For the manager Jules Morvand, whom
Destranges and others had persuaded to do Lohengrin, Werther, and Samson et
Dalila at the Théâtre Graslin, he had nothing but contempt. Here, he wrote, was
a manager who negotiated his contract to do less and less opera in each year
that passed, who saved money by not hiring opera singers and so placed oper-
etta singers in inappropriate roles (such as Dalila), and who would abandon the
new opera that his cahier required (a case in point was the two promised perfor-
mances of Alfred Bruneau’s Le Rêve) “in order to replace it with some worthless
operetta” [pour céder la place à quelque opérette sans valeur].31 By the time he
reached his peroration condemning Morvand’s three- year tenure (which had
been a profitable one), Destranges had worked himself into incandescent rage;
but there was a musical villain as well as a human one:

Every serious work was sacrificed in advance by a manager who lavished care on
operetta alone. Grand operas were hardly rehearsed, while six, perhaps eight, rehearsals
were devoted to sixth- rate fantasies. Three or four artists of merit lost amid nobodies
you wouldn’t want even in Carpentras; terrible stagings; a dreadful chorus; a ballet
mistress who wasn’t up to scratch.32
The reference to an uncivilized Midi was gratuitous but the message clear: via
operetta, Morvand had brought nothing but decadence.
It was for this reason, one that resonated with Parisian guilt about Second-
Empire frivolity, that across the French regions operetta could be a political
and aesthetic football, sometimes for several decades, before achieving the kind
of respectability that took it from café- concerts to a natural place on Grand-
Théâtre stages. Routinely denied subsidy and relegated to summer seasons
(leaving the winter for proper opera), operetta nevertheless became progres-
sively mainstream in part because it was essential for the purposes of cross-
subsidy for opera. Even in 1930s Bordeaux, it reached the local conservatoire
curriculum, a class being opened for it as a specialist study in the academic year
1933– 1934.
In the period after 1870, only in urban Alsace was Second- Empire oper-
etta embraced, in regionalist vein, as an unalloyed good. Among non- German
Alsatians, it was an expression of nostalgia for those in internal exile. When
the popular singer Jules Pacra opened a new show at the Strasbourg Casino in
February 1875, its title alone caused a sensation: Madame Angot et ses demoiselles.
A riff on Lecocq’s La Fille de Madame Angot of 1872, it was, wrote François
Schwab, “a musical romp . . . . a joyous pot- pourri of follies and of musi-
cal reminiscences taken from Lecocq, from Hervé, and from other operetta
kings, and in which M. Pacra will play the lead role.”33 The first night was an
uproarious mix of travesti (not just Pacra but also a female Figaro singing from
Rossini’s Barbier), chanson, instrumental interludes and operetta, played to an
excitable full house in searing heat. The audience, though huge, was “choisi”
[select]— indicating a high turnout of bilingual bourgeoisie. Of the operetta,
Schwab simply said it lasted an hour and made you laugh for sixty minutes.34

ses soins qu’à l’opérette. On répétait à peine les grands opéras alors qu’on consacrait des six,

210 French Musical Life
Like Destranges, Strasbourg’s most senior Francophone critic was a Wagnerian
(and a Brahms- lover); but unlike Destranges, as a francophone Alsatian he saw
no incompatibility between applauding French operetta and enthusiastically
reviewing Strasbourg’s Wagner productions, which had been part and parcel of
the operatic landscape since the 1850s. In February and March 1875, Rienzi and
Madame Angot received equally positive attention from him.
Following a long- standing French desideratum of “everything in its place,”
it might be countered that Schwab would have reacted more like Destranges
if Madame Angot had been mounted at the Grand- Théâtre. On the basis of
what happened with Offenbach’s Grande- Duchesse the following year, I doubt
it for reasons that underscore Strasbourg’s difference. The Strasbourg munici-
pal theater’s 1876 production of Die Großherzogin von Gerolstein was mounted
at Carnival time. The municipal theater was contested territory. It had been
transformed in 1872 into a German opera house, but for three long years the
municipality had refused to subsidize it, and the Alsatians who opted to stay in
Strasbourg rather than to move to France tended to shun it except in extraor-
dinary circumstances. Carmen in 1880 (its first Strasbourg performance) was one
such occasion; Offenbach’s blockbuster was another. The theater was full to the
rafters, with a mixed German and Alsatian audience. Here was a work emblem-
atic of French Second- Empire decadence, but Schwab’s perspective was not to
see it as self- indulgence or even as a satire of Napoléon III but as a satire on
“German small- court culture” [des petites cours allemandes] and to appropri-
ate its very frivolity as so deliciously French that it was both untranslatable and
alien to Germanic performance traditions. The German text turned the caustic
delicacy of Meilhac and Halévy’s satire into “a grotesque dead weight” [une
charge grotesque et plate], and every one of the performers failed to capture
the music’s “coupling of eccentricity and finesse” [l’excentricité doublée de
finesse]. They did their best, he wrote, but “their nature does not extend to
this genre” [leur nature ne comporte pas ce genre]— proof of that particular
observation being nowhere more apparent than in the fact that the heroine, the
soprano Anna- Maria van Hasselt- Barth, declined to dance the Act II cancan
with her co- conspirators.35 This was a review rendered all the more nostalgic
by its framing: as with other operas that might have been known from the old
days, Schwab evoked the “exuberant memories” [folâtres réminiscences] of the
French Strasbourg premiere of 17 November 1867— to the point of listing the
entire original cast.36

Operatic Competition
Beyond German Alsace and Lorraine of this first generation after 1870, there
was no reason for French operetta to be welcomed with such open arms; else-
where, the salacious wit of Offenbach, Hervé, and Lecocq or the picturesque
all- but- operetta scores of Edmond Audran37 were either accepted as inevitable
or derided as a sell- out, the period immediately after 1870 being especially
painful because councils that could not afford subsidy in the aftermath of the
war often had to fall back unwillingly on the cheap option— which promptly
thrived at the expense of more august genres. In terms of its presence, then, as
a winter- season offering on any principal regional stage, in many ways operetta
was a litmus test for municipal operatic and decentralist ambition.
There were major towns where the question of “sullying” the opera- house
stage with a lower genre did not arise. In Montpellier, operetta became stan-
dard fare on the Grand- Théâtre stage from the 1850s, starting with Offenbach’s
satire on traveling opera companies, Tromb- al- cazar. In postderegulation Lille,
the two main theaters mixed and matched at will once they came under a
single manager. Grand Opera was taken out of the Grand- Théâtre’s cahier des
charges in 1865– 1866 and Jules- Henry Vachot put on four new operettas, one
féerie and three opéras- comiques, of which La Belle Hélène took the lion’s share
of performances.38 The following year he put on regular operetta at the sec-
ondary theater, the Théâtre des Variétés (which was unsurprising), with three
new Offenbach works alongside two opéras- comiques. Astonishingly, however,
in August 1866 he added Meyerbeer’s L’Africaine, which outran all his other
productions.39 These relaxed encounters of high and low genres— a feature of
Lille’s musical culture more generally— help explain the incidence of even more
bizarre pairings in the 1890s, including the Chansons de Desrousseaux, a homage
to Lille’s most prominent chansonnier, with text by the mayor Géry Legrand,
placed immediately after the French premiere of Wagner’s Flying Dutchman and
probably intended to draw the attention of Parisian audience members to the
existence of a major local figure.40

212 French Musical Life
Smaller theaters with resident companies, including those that had once been
arrondissement theaters, tended to swap Grand Opera for operetta in the cahier
des charges, leaving opéra- comique as the most serious operatic genre in play. In
Avignon, operetta is introduced in the 1864– 1865 season; thereafter, it is listed
alongside Grand Opera until at least 1868 to 1869; by 1877– 1878 the top musi-
cal genres comprise opéra- comique and opérette; ten years later, only operetta
remains. Grand Opera returns briefly in the early 1890s but is scrubbed out of
the draft cahier for 1894– 1895. After a further flirtation with Grand Opera in
1910– 1911, by 1913– 1914, opéra- comique and operetta are the only required musi-
cal genres.41 It is unsurprising that in these circumstances, managers wanting to
preserve opera tried to band together— on a more local level than the projects
of Halanzier or Cazelles discussed in ­ chapter 5 in this volume. Hence, in 1899,
the former manager at Nîmes and the then manager at Avignon put together a
proposal for shared gala performances in their two towns, including both opera
and operetta. Their ambition stretched to Die Walküre, and to their Provençal
heartlands becoming the operatic envy of Lyon and Marseille. Unusual in its
bilateralism, the fate of this decentralist plan was nevertheless entirely predictable.
It got nowhere.42
For towns that had always enjoyed resident companies and set great store by
their main theaters as opera houses, the main battle was with opéra- comique—
which for all the glitz of Grand Opera nevertheless formed the staple oper-
atic genre in most provincial theaters for much of the century.43 In Bordeaux,
Théophile Gravière, whose managerial service at the Grand- Théâtre extended
for an astonishing thirteen years (1886– 1899), asked from the outset to do winter-
season operetta. His reasoning: the “charming works” [œuvres charmantes] of
Adam and Hérold were too old- fashioned to draw audiences.44 The background
to his argument would have been familiar to residents from the 1850s onward.
They would have seen the popularity of operetta building up swiftly, and prob-
ably contributed to it: Offenbach’s successful visit with Hortense Schneider in
1855; the effect of the Bouffes- Parisiens’ summer tour of 1864 on the summer
opera season at the Grand- Théâtre (according to the aggrieved theater manager

Bernard);45 the decades- long career of Jean Bory as an operetta bass at the
Théâtre du Gymnase and the Folies- Bordelaises;46 the saturation of Bordeaux’s
stages with operetta in the 1870s, where the Alcazar, the Folies- Bordelaises, the
Cirque National, the Théâtre Français Bordelais, the Théâtre des Variétés, and
weekly bandstand concerts on the place Dauphine produced 207 performances
of Lecocq and Offenbach in the 1877– 1878 season alone, an overall average
of more than seventeen performances per month across winter and summer
seasons alike.47 Especially when presented “with cuts, for family viewing” [avec
coupures à l’usage des familles]— as when the Bouffes- Parisiennes returned to
Bordeaux under Pietro Bono— there was no stopping it.48
The 1890 Rouen fudge of accepting certain examples of operetta under
the category of “assimilated works” indicates as much— the burning question
being what could be accepted as an opéra- comique in disguise. Tortuous language
graced the minutes of the council meeting of 11 April 1890 when this was dis-
cussed. The council had reaffirmed its ban on operetta and yet a reporter from
the Theater Committee explained the loophole that had also been agreed:
Nevertheless, you have decided that the Theater Committee should be the judge of
the precise reach of this exclusion and that it could in principle accept, in assimilat-
ing them as opéras- comiques, certain operettas that simultaneously display recognized
musical value and an appropriate plot; it was understood, moreover, that the Theater
Committee would regulate the maximum number of performances of these musical
works assimilated to opéra- comique.

Auguste Taillefer, the Théâtre des Arts manager for that year, put on twenty-
two operas and opéras- comiques and ten operettas. One of those operas was the
Lohengrin of February 1891 that made Rouen famous as the first French public
stage to mount it, bringing Parisian critics, audiences, and money to the town;
his production of Reyer’s Salammbô of 22 November 1890 was a French pre-
miere, hot on the heels of the Brussels world premiere ten months before. Both
were central to the attempt by managers themselves to turn Rouen’s Théâtre

des Arts into the premier provincial opera house. But despite the high receipts
for these two premieres, and despite the ballast of his ten operettas, Taillefer
withdrew from his contract in April 1891 under financial strain.50 For all its
attractiveness, operetta was not a panacea.
Nevertheless, it remained a magnet for fears about unfair competition and
inappropriate commercialism right into the 1920s. And as such it became an
indicator of continuing operatic seriousness. Rouen’s resistance to operetta was
part of a struggle toward becoming a first- tier operatic center; the same was
true of Nantes. For those who had always been at the top, there was apparently
more to lose. When Albert Vizentini asked Lyon’s council for 25,000F to run a
seventh- month Grand- Théâtre season— devoted to operetta— he was turned
down on the grounds that it was a commercial genre.51 The council at Marseille
resisted operetta at the Théâtre Beauvau until 1911, when, taking a leaf out of
Rouen’s book, manager Amédée Saugey slipped Lehár’s Amour Tzigane under
the wire as an “opéra- comique.”52 But in 1913, the council refused him permis-
sion to do Lecocq’s La Fille de Madame Angot, and as late as 1919, the Théâtre
Beauvau cahier des charges still forbade operetta.53 These were works suitable for
Marseille’s Théâtre du Gymnase, not for the Grand- Théâtre. It is in the light
of a decades- long tradition of generic separation across two municipal the-
aters that we can also understand the reverse phenomenon of 1925 in Toulouse,
where the entire company at the Variétés rose up against the idea of granting
the Capitole, newly rebuilt after the fire of 1919, a summer season of operetta.54
In the end, operetta would not reach the Capitole’s stage until 1931 when the
Variétés succumbed to the next wave of massed entertainment and was turned
into a cinema.55

tradition. In Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, the resident opera com-
pany remained in place until World War II; in Nantes, the opera company
lasted until 1935, the operetta company until 1968, and the ballet company
until 1990.56 While a star system based on ever- changing guest appearances
rendered the opera scene increasingly fluid and international elsewhere, France
developed a series of pragmatic responses that met growing audience demand
for performer novelty amid slow repertorial expansion. One— the welcoming
of foreign touring opera in the original language— was especially prevalent
in southern or border communities such as Marseille and Toulouse (Italian
companies) or Alsace (German), and lasted throughout the century under dis-
cussion. A second, the appearance of “artistes en représentation” to punctuate
a resident- company season, had its analogue in well- established traditions of
virtuoso and child- prodigy touring of the eighteenth century and developed
into the international operatic system still in operation today. A third phenom-
enon, which arrived later for opera than for spoken theater and was viewed
in the provinces with a mixture of relief and wariness, was the Paris- based
company— whether a national Parisian theater on a summer tour or a specialist
touring group. A fourth possibility involved local swaps or visits: something of
a return to arrondissement practices, but now organized as bilateral agreements
between towns.57 These modes of organization each answered different decen-
tralist questions and provided some unwelcome answers.
The phenomenon of “artistes en représentation” was an obvious, though
expensive, answer to the problem of the unchanging audience that had become
bored with its resident- company principals once the excitement of the débuts
season was past. Expensive because it was always about importing singers rather
than swapping them, from the mid- century onward it was built into the business
plans of the most prominent managers; and it became a traditional part of oper-
atic culture not only in southern towns such as Toulouse and Marseille, where
voices had always been more important than repertory as a reason to go to the
theater, but also in centers such as Rouen and Lyon. The capacity to attract
Parisian singers was, from the inception of French Grand Opera, a guarantor
of quality, and something of which the Lyonnais were intensely proud.58 Thirty
years later, it was for related reasons that while in post at Marseille, Bordeaux,
and Lyon, Halanzier kept up an intensive correspondence with Émile Perrin,

manager of the Paris Opéra, to secure stars on long- term loan. His aim was
to deepen the company as cheaply as he could, while being able to vaunt the
Parisian credentials of his visitors and to integrate them into ensemble perfor-
mances as well— the ideal compromise between the resident company and the
star system.59
Local theater historians of the period occasionally attribute the breaking
even of selected seasons uniquely to the presence of guest artists and note the
“abuse” of their presence as a sensationalist tactic implemented from too early a
point in the season.60 Reformers looking for reasons to ditch the resident com-
pany system needed to look no further than the prevalence of such “artistes”—
whose presence meant that salaried company members accumulated days
off on full pay.61 In the immediate aftermath of the Franco- Prussian War the
resident- company model was under strain: prophetically, manager Comminges
in Toulouse experimented in 1872 with a company that included no resident
principals, so that he could bring in stars for each production.62 A decade
later, the Toulouse council debated the question as potentially enabling cost-
cutting: “With a good opéra- comique company and a few performances of Grand
Opera done with visiting artists, the theater could easily undertake next sea-
son without subsidy” [avec une bonne troupe d’opéra comique et quelques
représentations de grand opéra que l’on pourrait donner avec des artistes de
passage, le théâtre pourrait très bien faire la campagne prochaine sans subven-
tion].63 Nancy did something similar early in the tenure of the young Michel
Chabance (around 1908– 1909), Chabance being inspired by the touring-
company model of the legendary Charles Baret.64 A middle way is detectable in
Rouen, where the increasing rarity (and price) of the “fort ténor” encouraged
Raoul François, applying in 1899 to manage the Théâtre des Arts, to offer a full
company bar this one role, saying: “For a few works, Guillaume Tell, Robert and
others I will engage a visiting first tenor if need be” [Pour quelques ouvrages,
Guillaume Tell, Robert et autres, il sera engagé un fort ténor en représentation, si

besoin est]. He was duly appointed.65 As we have seen, such weakening of the
underpinnings of the resident- company system became normal in the postwar
period, coinciding with conspicuous internationalization in the selection of star
singers such that the history of an opera house like that of Rouen, Marseille, or
Toulouse can seem, for the 1920s and 1930s, like little more than a procession
of visitor names from Italy, Germany, and Russia.66 By this stage, the job of the
resident- company manager had changed beyond all recognition.
During the licensing period before July 1864, foreign touring companies
contributed to the local licensed manager’s revenue according to his taxation
rights; thereafter, apart from the dreaded Poor Tax, they floated free. In the
1860s, traveling Italian companies sometimes provided the only opera avail-
able to audiences in towns with no subsidy for a resident company. Yet on
many occasions during the period of licensing, there was no longer a resident
manager to reap the benefit. As Christian Goubault notes of Rouen, the Paris
Théâtre Italien company arrived in each of 1864, 1865, and 1873 seasons at
the very moment that the town’s resident company collapsed.67 Foreign trav-
eling opera could also be a political issue, as in July Monarchy Strasbourg,
where German and Italian companies were allowable guests of the licensed
French theater manager as long as they could be treated as collective “artistes en
représentation” appearing at the end of a season.68 When a German opera com-
pany managed by Bode was expelled in the early 1830s, the German- repertoire
supporters railed against petty linguistic bureaucracy that deprived Strasbourg
citizens of something comparable to the Bayonne and Perpignan publics hav-
ing Spanish companies in winter, the Marseillais having their Italian opera and
the Calais public their Shakespeare.69 In 1832, perhaps in response to the Bode
expulsion, there was a petition for a resident German company.70 However,
a proposed multilingual season in 1837– 1838 caused consternation at the
Préfecture and the Ministry, doubtless because it replaced both Grand Opera

and opéra- comique with Italian and German works, leaving only French drama
intact.71 From the late 1840s, German operatic visits to Strasbourg seem to
have stopped entirely; the summer 1855 visit by Roeder that included France’s
first Tannhäuser and was to have included its premiere of Lohengrin was the first
such visit in seven years.72 As per the taxation system, a three- month visit was
secured via the blessing of the regular manager Ferdinand Jourdain, who had
no wish to try to attempt a summer season in competition with the Exposition
Universelle in Paris.73
For managers in towns that hung on to their resident companies after 1864,
the loss of this kind of revenue constituted yet another financial headache; in
towns that abandoned their resident company or who had always been part of
the arrondissement system, such tours were a boon, bringing repertoire— old and
new— of which their audiences might have been deprived for years, or which
they had perhaps never witnessed. The case of secondary towns in an area such
as Lower Brittany, with no large conurbation, dispersed coastal towns, and late-
arriving railway links, is emblematic. It provides the geographical focus of my
discussion here. Lying between Brest and Lorient (which had the only resident
companies), Quimper was formerly an arrondissement town receiving fitful visits
from the bottom- rank traveling company, and whose only regular theater space
until 1904 was part of the town museum. From the 1870s onward, the Quimper
town hall was swamped by offers from touring companies of all kinds, enabling
it to avoid the resident company model entirely even after the opening of its
dedicated theater.74 For such communities, the municipal theater as venue for
hire was considerably more cost- effective than the municipal theater as creator of
a season’s worth of entertainment. It guaranteed variety, and that variety included
both opera and operetta, often alongside boxing matches, gymnastics displays, and
amateur concerts.
The benefits and drawbacks of touring opera had been debated among the-
ater professionals since at least the 1840s and formed a subset of the debates on
a prospective liberté in the 1860s and, with hindsight, in the 1870s. There was
considerable support for abandoning the resident- company system altogether,
though there were inevitable differences of opinion as to what might replace
71. In 1837– 1838, the final year of their contract, the Mandataire- Gérant C. G. Hehl and

way of avoiding the expense of French Grand Opera (they proposed to offer only La Juive).

it.75 Nevertheless, because the burden of much of the discussion centered as
much on performance quality as on financial viability, and because most the-
ater professionals were impervious to arguments about local pride, the most
common rationale was that a single homogeneous company specializing in a
small number of works would be vastly preferable to the resident- company
system. In its purest form, it boiled down to a company (usually Paris- based)
specializing in a single work— or a single work per tour. In contrast to spoken
theater, the lyric stage provides few examples of this extreme. Offenbach’s La
Grande- Duchesse seems to have been a pioneer; Lehár’s La Veuve joyeuse fol-
lowed in its footsteps half a century later. In between, Gustave Charpentier’s Le
Couronnement de la muse—
less opera than community musical spectacle— was
toured from 1898 by his Société des Fêtes de la Muse du Peuple, a company
run out of Paris. By the time their publicist, J. Braut, started selling it to the
Exposition Internationale de l’Est (1909), the company had already taken it to
twenty festival events in fifteen French towns stretching from Béziers to Lille,
and a further two in Belgium.76
Few large- scale operas could sustain this kind of monoculture, though it is
clear that among them were Faust, Mignon, and La Traviata. There is no sign that
anything as opulent as French Grand Opera was ever attempted as a touring rep-
ertoire, ubiquitous though it remained on municipal stages— which meant that
smaller towns that had perhaps received some opéra- comique before 1864 now
leapfrogged most of Meyerbeer and Halévy to find themselves being offered
lyric opera dating from the Second Empire onward. Gounod’s Faust appears
in Quimper on 10 July 1888 courtesy of the Compagnie Lyrique Parisienne
(Tournées Simon Maurice). It was trumpeted as their 134th tour performance,
their poster also reassuring spectators that the company was the same as had
done Mignon the previous year. In 1888, Faust was the only piece the company
offered to the town council, suggesting that it did one opera or a double- bill
per tour. As a business model, it seems not to have lasted. The year 1889 marked
the company’s sixth season, and in addition to Mignon they had built up a mixed
repertory: Messager’s La Fauvette du temple, Hervé’s Mam’zelle Nitouche, Verdi’s
La Traviata, Maillart’s Les Dragons de Villars, and Adam’s Le Chalet.

time the company pitched to Rennes in 1894, it had dropped the Adam from
its letterhead and all its new listed works were plays— moreover, Maurice pulled
out of his Rennes engagement at less than a fortnight’s notice, citing “a series
of disastrous takings” [une série de recettes désastreuses].78 That same year, the
Tournée Léonce Dalbret pitched an unidentified work to Rennes and included
in its letterhead a list of plays, but its main claim to fame lay elsewhere, in that
the same letterhead boasted that it had toured Audran’s Miss Helyett 472 times
in the four years since the company’s foundation.79 Operetta was, once again,
triumphant.
These kinds of touring company swept in for a single performance and swept
out again. Others, bearing several works, stayed longer. Quimper’s experience
in 1883 and 1885 with a touring company run by Gustave Le Roy (of the Paris
Opéra- Comique) seems to have worked on a model whereby several opéras-
comiques or operettas were offered, including Adam’s Postillon de Longjumeau,
Maillart’s Les Dragons de Villars, Audran’s La Mascotte, Paër’s Le Maître de chapelle,
Lorient- born Massé’s Galathée, and Meyerbeer’s Breton- themed Le Pardon de
Ploërmel.
80 For larger- scale opera, Quimper accepted offers from the resident
company at Lorient from at least the 1870s onward, and the council sought out
operatic visits from both Lorient and Brest after the completion of its theater
in 1904.81 Thereafter, the provenance of opera tended to be either regional
through these same partnerships or secured via touring companies and agen-
cies such as those of Charles Baret (Paris), Edmond Souché (Paris), and Albert
Chartier (Bois- Colombes— just outside Paris). This was how prewar Quimper
first saw some of the staples of Third- Republic French opera: Samson et Dalila,
Lakmé, and Carmen, alongside lashings of operetta. Courtesy of Chartier, La
Veuve joyeuse came three years running, from 1911 to 1913.82
All these touring companies came from Paris, enabling a decentralized expe-
rience by means of centralized resources operated not by the state but by the
free market. So, largely, did the agencies that managed other groups, and which
are frequently to be found establishing long- term relationships with French
municipalities for the provision of theatrical entertainment. From an environ-
ment of intense competition came another equally centralizing model— that of
a single agency looking to secure exclusive territory. This is what tour agents
Charnault and Mertz (Paris) did in northwest Brittany in the early 1920s.

has opened (AM Quimper 12 I QUI_ 01). After 1904, the fact that the Lorient and Brest
theaters were often under the same manager facilitated such arrangements.

Operatic Competition
Having secured agreements with northern and coastal towns, when they tried
in 1923 to extend their range and broker such an agreement for lyric theater
in Quimper, they cited in support of their case their “monopolies” [privileges]
for 1922– 1923 at Saint- Brieuc and Dinan, renewed for 1923– 1924, and their
new (and also exclusive) contract with Morlaix for 1923– 1924. Their aim was
to secure exclusive rights to choose from the entire repertoires of the Opéra,
Opéra- Comique, Gaîté- Lyrique, and Trianon- Lyrique, together with (money-
spinning) Viennese repertory including La Veuve joyeuse—
all in return for pro-
viding six or seven performances per year.83 It was, within a deregulated market,
a return to the old days of the arrondissement system.
The most successful touring agencies ranged across France while preserv-
ing long- standing relationships via annual visits. Charles Baret, for instance,
served Breton theaters from Saint- Brieuc to Quimper to Rennes for more than
thirty- five years from the 1890s. But he was also responsible for brokering the
three gala tours of the Ballets Suédois to the west of France: from Brest, Lorient,
and Rennes to Nantes and the Loire valley, down to Biarritz and across to
Marseille, in November 1921, August 1922, and January 1925. Audiences in full
evening dress paying up to 12F per ticket watched Le Marchand d’oiseaux (music
by Tailleferre), La Jarre (Casella), Chopin (eponymous), Le Porcher (Ferroud), and
Dansgille and Les Vierges folles (Bigot and Atterberg, respectively— both scores
based on Swedish folk tunes). These were, as Marie- Claire Mussat points out,
not the ballets that represented the modernist edginess of the Suédois: there was
no Relâche in 1925 or Les Mariés de la Tour Eiffel in 1921.84 And public response
was mixed: Mussat compares the muted audience response to La Jarre at Nantes
in 1925 with the excitement of Paul Ladmirault, Nantes’s most prominent com-
poser, and compares downbeat reactions to Swedish folk music with the upbeat
response to that of the Russians.85 Moreover, at Brest La Jarre had to be replaced
by Les Vierges folles because the local musicians who completed the touring
orchestra found Casella’s neoclassical score too difficult on a single rehearsal.86
These factors, together with clerical protests about seminudity, and superficial
local reviews, led Mussat to view the Suédois tours as a “missed opportunity”
[un rendez- vous manqué]— on both sides— for the promotion of modernist art
as defined by Paris.
Mussat is undoubtedly right, but I would see the reasons as potentially dif-
ferent. For instance, the Suédois, which took the same programs wherever they

went, might have reaped different rewards— at least in 1925— had they taken a
full band and revived the Cole Porter/ Charles Koechlin jazz ballet Within the
Quota (1923). After all, the Suédois’s touring routes took in all the major north-
west ports and towns— Brest, Saint- Nazaire, Nantes, Le Mans, Angers— that
had first welcomed the musical sensation of black American military bands,
starting with a “public rehearsal” by James Reese Europe’s Harlem Hellfighters
on 1 January 1918 on the Brest quayside.87 The band’s first formal concert
was at the Théâtre Graslin in Nantes the following month, after which a sur-
real mixture of concert tour, luxury resort work, and service in the trenches
awaited them. Their return journey in January 1919 took in Le Mans and Brest.
Immediately thereafter, and in contrast to the general spread of dance bands in
resorts (seaside, spa, winter sports), where they routinely preceded and followed
opera performances, there is little immediate sign of further jazz activity in
Brittany itself.88 But the warm public reception of the first American dance-
music operettas in Rennes— starting with Youmans’s No- No Nanette in March
1928— also suggests probable success for Porter’s jazz ballet had it been part of
the Suédois’s 1925 tour.89 There was, in other words, an artistic connection to
be made with the recent musical experience of France’s Atlantic seaboard— an
experience inextricable moreover from the scent of liberation, and the link was
either overlooked or rejected.
Second, that final tour (1925) in Brittany could have been presented in col-
laboration with modernist artists of the Seiz Breur, founded in 1923. Here the
synergies between the Suédois and their Breton hosts would have included
meeting points of folk tradition and modernism, and the expression of national
identity through art. The partner premiere in 1923 to Porter’s ballet was
Milhaud’s La Création du monde, also jazz- based, and here, references to African
folk art combined with the high modernism of Fernand Léger’s body sculptures
and the antidance of Jean Börlin’s choreography would have made quite a state-
ment. But once again, the score— particularly its jazz fugue— would likely have
necessitated bringing their own band. I do not know whether Rolf de Maré,
the manager of the Ballets Suédois, suggested any such collaborative work; but
the self- sufficiency of touring ready- made productions, and the sequence of
one- night- only performances, would in any case have militated against any
sense of artistic partnership— which might have taken the form of program
notes, exhibitions, or complementary concerts. Beyond dumbing down a bit, in
the grand tradition of Parisian centralization the Ballets Suédois swept through

Technology
It might seem perverse to include a discussion of technology in a chapter on
competition, when hindsight reveals the extent to which cinema and broad-
casting, in particular, brought new employment opportunities for musicians
and helped in the dissemination of provincial opera to new audiences locally
and beyond, Paris included.90 By 1926, the Capitole was broadcasting opera
performances on the local private radio station, Radio Toulouse.91 The previous
season, both Rouen and Marseille had brought cinema into the opera house
for the first time via screenings of the historical fiction film Le Miracle des loups,
with music by Henri Rabaud played by the resident orchestra.92 At Marseille,
this was something of a statement, coinciding as it did with the inaugural season
of the new Théâtre Municipal, which was built as a state- of- the- art art déco pal-
ace following a devastating fire at the Beauvau in 1919. At Rouen, local opera
historian Henri Geispitz, who had already spent many of his chronicle entries
lamenting the rise of operetta, accepted the advent of cinema in world- weary
fashion as an unfortunate inevitability:
Thus did cinema make its entry into the Théâtre des Arts. It was of course accompa-
nied by first- class music, performed by the usual orchestra under M. Brisard’s baton,
but it was still cinema, with all the incongruities and tricks of the genre. It is true that
the [Paris] Opéra had shown it with great ceremony, a few months before, and that
M. Chabance could not be attacked for following this example.93
As reported by Geispitz, the film was shown eleven times— more than each
of the two most popular operas that season (Massenet’s Manon and Rabaud’s
own Mârouf), which were performed eight times each, or Carmen and Tosca
90. The roots of these developments, including the remote opera attendance made pos-
sible by the théâtrophone from the 1890s onward, are the subject of a forthcoming mono-
graph by Sarah Fuchs Sampson, Opera on the Line: A Technological History of French Operatic
Culture, 1870– 1914.

(seven and six times, respectively). Moreover, cinema was quickly integrated
into programs, both commemorative and artistic. In the same month, April
1925, a memorial event for the Belgian poet Émile Verhaeren included film
footage of his funeral; then, at the end of the month, the theater mounted
the inventor Raoul Grimoin- Samson’s self- described cinéma- dramatique Le
Comte de Griolet, a tale of the French Revolution in which, as Geispitz put it,
“invisible artists declaimed words or sang arias which the on- screen characters
were supposed to be saying or singing” [des artistes invisibles prononçaient les
paroles ou chantaient les airs que les personnages de l’écran étaient censés dire
ou chanter].94 Cinema, he wrote, “gradually took possession” [prenait donc
possession peu à peu] of Rouen’s major theater.95
If the objections to technology here were primarily aesthetic— perceptions
of verisimilitude and naturalness— those of practicing musicians were more
mundane. Cinema and particularly radio threatened the prevailing order in
various ways. As with sports fixtures broadcast live today, new media disrupted
schedules and forced institutions to harmonize their programming accordingly.
In towns where the relationships between conservatoire, conservatoire orches-
tra, and theater band were close, delicate balances were upset by a new player
with enough money to exert power. The mid- 1930s saw these shifts play out
with particular intensity. In Toulouse, the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire
had to shift its entire season in 1934– 1935 because the public radio station (the
PTT) had decided to broadcast on Tuesdays and Fridays only: they could not
afford to lose the revenue, besides which, these were “federated” broadcasts that
reached unusually wide audiences.96 Worse was to come a couple of years later,
when Radio- Toulouse- Pyrénées decided to hire a full- time forty- piece orches-
tra. The Capitole orchestra, which was unionized, immediately demanded full
municipal status— meaning annual contracts. They, like their colleagues across
France, were paid by the season (six months, in Toulouse) and expected to sup-
plement their incomes otherwise when the theater was closed; by contrast the
regional radio orchestra was advertising for year- round appointments and daily
performances. Predictably, the Capitole orchestra complained that their mem-
bers (i.e., the very men who were complaining) would audition successfully for
a plum job with a full annual salary, and the Capitole would be left with the
dregs and the nine Conservatoire professors who already had a stable additional
income.97 The city’s jewel, the Capitole, was under threat from forces that pre-
vented the accumulation of jobs that had hitherto served the city so well.

The disruptive power of radio for institutions involved in broadcasts was one
thing. Its effects on audience behavior were of a different order. Those “feder-
ated” broadcasts cut both ways in that they encouraged regular opera- goers to
stay at home— especially when they could access international- quality broad-
casts coming from Paris, Milan, Bayreuth, or Stuttgart. Moreover, unfortunate
clashes of repertoire with Paris broadcasts could destroy the best- laid local plans.
As manager of the Lyon and Marseille opera houses, Maurice Carrié fumed in
a survey response of 1936 at the fact that Paris received preferential treatment,
and that his engagement of star singers months in advance could be overtaken
by Paris broadcasts of the same opera on the same night. “Result: terrible ticket
sales” [Résulte: recette lamentable.], he wrote.98 Other managers were equally
downbeat: R. Audier, who succeeded the late Charles Baret as a theatrical tour
manager, thought the problem required the banning of all broadcasts of com-
plete works; among nearly a dozen respondents there was significant agreement
with Audier that regional theatre needed government assistance to claw back
revenues from the upstart radio, especially now that the government was taxing
wireless ownership.99
These were the downsides of new technology; but entrepreneurs saw things
differently. As early as 1906 and 1908, the félibre leader Frédéric Mistral and
his supporters were engaged in facilitating film versions of Mireille based on
Mistral’s epic poem of the same name, from Gaumont and Pathé. As I discuss
in ­ chapter 7, the operatic setting, premiered in 1864, gained a new if contested
lease of life as an outdoor festival event from 1899, and Mistral, who appeared in
several scenes of the 1908 film, supported all possible forms of dissemination for
his manifesto of Provençal life.100 Further cinematic versions followed in 1922
(including the Marseillais bass- baritone Auguste Boudouresque) and in 1933.
Equally savvy as a publicist was Castelbon de Beauxhostes, the mastermind of
the annual lyric spectaculars which ran from 1898 in the bullfighting arena at
Béziers. To advertise the 1926 iteration of Francis Bousquet’s Zorriga (premiered
1925), he organized a broadcast concert on Radio- Béziers featuring the cast;
moreover, in an unusual cross between a media listing and an old- fashioned
newspaper puff, the notice he published for Parisian readers in Radio- magazine
referenced him as Beziers’s “Maecenas” [mecène].101 The radio station also pro-
grammed a critique of the production for the following week.102

226 French Musical Life
It is perhaps no coincidence that these examples of the leveraging of cinema
and radio for the promotion of stage music both came from the Midi, for it was
here that some of the most innovative adaptations of opera took place, in ways
that reversed the traditional Paris– province flow of stage- music influence and
reappropriated Paris- consecrated meanings. Doing so entailed breaking free
not only of the capital but also of the municipal system that continued to take
its cues from the national theaters; opera was released into a new, open- air,
habitat. This form of regional operatic difference forms one of the subjects
of the next chapter. Yet there were other ways to throw down the gauntlet,
even within the municipal tradition. The famous and unique case of Wagner’s
Lohengrin as a triumph of provincial over Parisian opera cultures was made pos-
sible because of near paralysis in Paris; this episode, too, receives close scrutiny.
Finally, I reconsider the fraught term couleur locale, and reflect on new levels of
musicopoetic interrogation of what it meant to be “regional.” Mireille returns
here, in all her contested glory.
