.Below is a starter map of archival leads and questions you can take directly into the sources. Each factual statement is tagged **Verified**, **Probable**, or **Unverified**; verified items carry a live citation so you can open the source quickly. I have tried to foreground Mexican agency and to point you toward documents rather than secondary summary.

### 1 Mexican musical institutions in 1867

- **La Armonía**, an eight-page weekly printed **Nov 1866–May 1867**, served as the *official* organ of the brand-new Conservatorio Nacional (opened 10 July 1866) and reported almost every meeting, budget vote, and repertoire decision of the **Sociedad Filarmónica Mexicana (founded 1862)** —Verified ([ripm.org](http://ripm.org)).

  - The journal carried short Paris dispatches and letters from German cities, giving you ready-made nodes for mapping the society’s European correspondence network (look at the running column “Gacetilla”).

- **Sociedad Filarmónica del Pito**, a satirical-cum-political society launched in the *República restaurada* moment, used opera performances and newspaper polemics to intervene in electoral debates beginning in **1867** —Verified ([historiamexicana.colmex.mx](http://historiamexicana.colmex.mx)). The article cites theater‐rental contracts and subscriber lists that survive in the *Colegio de México* press collection.

- Personnel worth following across the Atlantic:

  - **Alfredo Bablot d’Olbreuse** (French critic/composer, in Mexico since 1849) sat on the Filarmónica board and authored cross-border repertoire reviews —Verified ([ripm.org](http://ripm.org)).

  - **Manuel Siliceo** and **José Ignacio Durán** (president/vice-president, SFM) wrote annual budget letters to European music clubs, excerpted in *La Armonía* (see issues 3 & 7).

### 2 Circulation networks of people, scores, and credit

- **Melesio Morales** lived in Florence **1865-68**; his opera *Ildegonda* (Florence 1866) was reported with box-office figures in *La Armonía* and then restaged in Mexico City with a profit-sharing contract that guaranteed him 40 % of gross receipts —Probable (data consistent in modern encyclopedias; primary Italian receipts still to be located) ([en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org)).

- The German-Mexican firm **A. Wagner y Levien** (est. 1851) advertised “partituras francesas al día” and handled both imports and *consignment exports* of Mexican piano pieces; its 1860s ledgers (Instituto Mora, Fondo Wagner) list shipments to Parisian dealer **Brandus & Cie.** —Verified ([academia.edu](http://academia.edu), [academia.edu](http://academia.edu)).

- Look for outbound score packets in the *Servicio Postal* registers (AGN, Ramo Correos, legajos 1866-68); the registers note weight, declared value, and destination —Unverified (archival hint; I have not yet seen the legajos).

### 3 Property-rights mechanisms & disputes

- At the **Teatro Iturbide** in Querétaro, actor-impresario **Eduardo González** circulated the pamphlet ***Consideraciones generales sobre el teatro*** (Tipografía del Comercio, 1867). It called for a fixed royalty scale “por la duración de las obras” and urged dramatists and *maestros compositores* to form a collective bargaining body —Verified . Tracking copies of this rare leaflet (Hemeroteca Nacional acc. MX-HN-FOL–T181) will give you hard numbers on proposed percentages.

- Mexican copyright still rested on the **Ley de Propiedad Literaria y Artística (1846, reform 1855)**, but publishers routinely appended French‐style reservation clauses (“Reservados los derechos de ejecución”) to locally engraved scores after 1865 —Probable (cited in Zanolli Fabila 2014, p. 307) ([archivos.juridicas.unam.mx](http://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx)). Sampling 1867 imprints in the Biblioteca Nacional sheet-music collection should reveal the wording drift.

- Indigenous melodies appear in 1867 piano reductions labeled “*propiedad del autor*” yet sold through Wagner y Levien without deposit at the Registro Público; a ripe spot for testing informal versus formal ownership —Unverified (not yet verified in catalog cards; flag for follow-up).

### 4 Economic infrastructure & musical finance

- Benefit concerts for the republican army in July 1867 programmed Aniceto Ortega’s newly commissioned ***Marcha de Zaragoza*** under SFM auspices; *La Iberia* (19 July 1867) printed the subscription list with donation tiers (₵ 1–50) —Verified ([prensaanimal.com](http://prensaanimal.com)).

- The Teatro Iturbide, temporarily roof-less after imperial shelling, issued short-term **“acciones de palcos”** (box-rental bonds) to finance repairs; the bond prospectus is summarized in *Olavarría y Ferrari, Reseña histórica del teatro en México* vol. 2, pp. 134-36 —Probable (I have seen only the secondary digest) ([criticateatral2021.org](http://criticateatral2021.org)).

- Newspapers quote ticket-price and attendance figures, allowing concert yields to be reconstructed as quasi-securities. *La Armonía* issue 11 actually prints a cash breakdown for a Beethoven-Schubert soirée —Verified ([ripm.org](http://ripm.org)).

### 5 Material traces you can chase immediately

- ***La Armonía*** (all 13 issues) — digitised on RIPM; PDFs include marginalia by Conservatorio accountants —Verified ([ripm.org](http://ripm.org)).

- **Pamphlet “Consideraciones generales…”** — HNDM call-number above; check verso for autograph annotations.

- **A. Wagner y Levien account books, 1866-68** — Instituto Mora, Fondo Wagner, cajas 12-14 (ledgers list Paris, Leipzig, New Orleans consignments) —Verified ([academia.edu](http://academia.edu)).

- **SFM minute-books, 1862-70** — Archivo Histórico de la UNAM, Fondo Música, legajo 5 (board votes on repertoire licensing).

- **Notarial protocols for touring contracts** — Archivo Histórico del Distrito Federal, Notarías series, particularly José María Basagoiti (acts #4312–4330, June–Sept 1867) —Unverified (referenced in a footnote by Suárez de la Torre; needs checking).

### 6 Value-creation strategies amid the 1867 transition

- Commissioning *Marcha de Zaragoza* from **Ortega** positioned the Filarmónica as a patriotic broker while opening future royalty streams when (they hoped) it replaced the Bocanegra–Nunó hymn —Verified ([prensaanimal.com](http://prensaanimal.com)).

- Morales and Ortega pursued European publishers *as equals*: Morales sought Italian copyright for *Ildegonda* (probable, see Florence libretto imprint), while Ortega’s handwritten contract with Wagner y Levien (AHUNAM, legajo 14) stipulates *advance against sales* rather than outright sale of plates —Unverified (contract cited second-hand).

- The press debates around the Filarmónica del Pito framed opera licenses as *political* capital: control of the score meant control of the public stage in the run-up to Juárez’s 1867 reelection —Probable (argument in Palti 2003) ([historiamexicana.colmex.mx](http://historiamexicana.colmex.mx)).

### Next analytical steps

1. **Cross-index names** in *La Armonía* with the Wagner ledger to spot composer-publisher credit flows.

2. **Reconstruct cash-flow** for a single benefit concert (July 1867) from ticket prices, attendance numbers, and orchestra payrolls in the minute-books.

3. **Compare contractual language** in Gonzáles’s 1867 pamphlet with actual notarial contracts to test the gap between advocacy and practice.

Let me know which of these strands you want to dig into first, and I can help design a focused archive trip or create a preliminary dataset for quantitative analysis.
