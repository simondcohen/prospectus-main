## Hurricane Relief Efforts (p. 182)

Between the night of October 7 and 8 of that year 1867, a tremendous hurricane devastated the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, leaving many victims, collapsed houses, missing persons, and people under the rubble. The Mexicans of the capital opened subscriptions to provide economic aid, and several functions were given for this purpose at the Teatro Gótico and a concert by the Sociedad Filarmónica.**\[22\]** For its part, the Junta Promovedora de Socorros para los pueblos devastados (Relief Promotion Board for the devastated towns) set about organizing a great bullfight that, according to the newspaper El Globo, would mark an epoch in the annals of Mexican tauromaquia. It was scheduled at the plaza of the Paseo Nuevo for the afternoon of Sunday, November 3 at three-thirty in the afternoon. The bullfighting troupe would be that of the ever-present Bernardo Gaviño, and the rate was set at ten pesos for a box seating eight people, one peso for a seat in the shade, and fifty centavos for one in the sun. Both El Monitor Republicano and La Iberia announced its program with the order of the function, appealing to the charitable sentiments of the capitalinos, but above all the second, promoting the "attractions." In addition, La Iberia, a newspaper directed by the Spaniard Anselmo de la Portilla, explained to its readers what the function would consist of: six bulls to die, bulls for coleadero \[tail-grabbing\], embolado bull \[bull with covered horns\], amateurs, partitioning of the plaza by the toreros, music, "embellishment" of the arena inside and out, and, of course, mojigangas \[theatrical farces\], which very much in keeping with the season, would represent that day El convidado de piedra \[The Stone Guest\] and doña Inés, with an accompaniment of skeletons and devils. It also alluded, as attractive, to the fact that the president of the Republic and the principal authorities of Mexico would attend, and that the "famous Bernardo" would debut a magnificent suit of amaranth color embroidered in gold and silver, arrived from Seville.**\[24\]**

## Results of the Charity Bullfight (pp. 183-184)

It was this same newspaper that, two days later, classified the bullfight as "magnificent," with a completely full plaza, bulls that "performed prodigies," "audacious" coleadores, a bull from Atenco "that poured in torrents through the arena the blood of the poor horses," a sunny and peaceful afternoon, a contented and amused public, but, above all, satisfied for having contributed "to wipe away the tears and satisfy the hunger of those who cry on the banks of the Bravo."**\[25\]** The press in general was more sparing with the matter. El Siglo Diez y Nueve limited itself to saying that the population had responded to the call, while El Monitor Republicano said that the brilliant part was in the coleadero performed by amateurs, who collected many applause and pink ribbons that were tied to the arm as a prize for their strength and gallantry." The editors of this newspaper calculated that the proceeds from the bullfight must have been about 4,000 pesos, "minus the bulls that were fought, the horses that came out wounded, and the one that succumbed in combat," with "large expenditures on the rental of the plaza, the work of the fighting company, and the cypress branches with zempazúchil flowers with which the arena was adorned for that charitable spectacle. Also charged were numerous "banderolas of the three guarantees" that waved that afternoon in clear allusion to the sentiment of independence that the majority experienced; thus it would symbolically become the last great bullfight before the president of the nation, Benito Juárez, prohibited the entertainment of bulls in the city of Mexico.**\[26\]**
